3 ContributorsLeave Me Lyrics
Alright, now we got my nigga Dizzy aka. Raw D out
You tryna get me stuck in a hole
Only got one soul, I know
From the ground up, coming soon
It's a lot of pressure and pain
But I'm ready for whatever call my name
And everybody puttin' them over things
Fought with 'em both, we can bring it on
Young money (Ooh dawg, ooh dawg)

I could give a fuck if you agree with me
'Cause I don't see nobody giving up no greenery
And everybody wanna be up on the scenery
Nigga look me eye to eye but he ain't seein' me
And all these niggas run around sayin' they seen a key
Ain't got a motherfucking thing, ain't seen a G
But always got they mouth open when it comes to me
I wanna know what the fuck you niggas done for me (Tell me, tell me)
Pussy motherfuckers probably run from me
Make me slap ya in ya mouth to get a gum from me
And you know it's only real niggas that run with me
So if I die, probably little niggas will come from me
Shit, it's gonna take like 10 million just to come for me
Yeah, I'm eatin' but I still feel hungry
You know I don't give a motherfuck, yeah I done this shit
And I'm done with it but don't fuck with me
You might also like
They tryna get me stuck in a hole
Only got one soul, I know
It's a lot of pressure and pain
But I'm ready for whatever, I'ma mess with that bitch
And everybody open they mouths but they ain't 'bout what I'm 'bout
We can bring it on
We can bring it on

Look, and I ain't worried 'bout the law neither
I ain't got nothin' on me, bitch, I'm all legal
And niggas sayin' what they saw talkin' to them people
They got my people in the place without them charges on 'em
And I get charged every day in my charger, homie
And I don't beef with niggas 'cause they all below me
And I don't eat with niggas 'cause we all ain't hungry
It's time to get this money, nigga, fuck your feelings
Who the fuck is gonna take care of your children, shit
Who was there when we were on top of them buildings, shit
I'm over my head, I'm on top of the ceiling
But I'm being real and that's how a nigga feel, fuck
And motherfuck how a motherfucker feel, yeah
I'm tryna feel how I feel to touch a meal
And everybody tryna get a deal
But my mind on these bricks and I'm on the bill
They tryna get me stuck in a hole
Only got one soul, I know
It's a lot of pressure and pain
But I'm ready for whatever, I'ma mess with that bitch
And everybody open they mouths but they ain't 'bout what I'm 'bout
We can bring it on
We can bring it onEmbed
