7 ContributorsI’m Yours REMIX Lyrics
Cure AGAIN!
HEY PRINCESS
Yeah
Yeah you
Give you more again Yeay

Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food
Knew I would score like Shaq did in school
Knew I was stupid, Knew I looked like a big fool
I must of had the flu, I thought the shit was cool
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do
But never knew you would murder me, what did I do
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you

Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
See Jason Mraz LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

I dont need no time and I dont need no reason
Im yours whenever whenever whenever ill be there
Til every season
Without you in my life
There would be no meaning
Baby im yours forever
Seasons come seasons go
Love you so much baby I don't know
I love you I love you I love you
Yeahhhhhhh

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you
Knew I would pull out my heart and bring it right to you
You knew all about me baby, but you wasn't about me baby
Young Wayne, prepare for change
Because it seem like girly don't care the same
You had my chain, you buried my name, then we had champagne
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a face and laughed
I guess what I'm be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure3Embed
