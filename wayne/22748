8 ContributorsBlood Thicker Lyrics
Stickin' together like glue
Blood is thick so I'm tight
Swimmin' for my people
Don't mind losin' my life
Ridin' or fryin'
Don't matter nigga I'm real
All the time
The red thicker than the clear
Get in the way
And you get maced in the face
50 niggas will chase
Put a end to yo' day
Hit yo' set in the black on black
With Macs
With red dots on 'em
Will leave you flat
Yo' moms with the black on her
On the front level
6 ft. is where you be there goes the men with the shovels
Blood thicker than water
I'ma keep it like that
Never turnin' my back
And I'ma keep it like that
Much love for my people
They got love for me
Outsiders get outta line
Get burnt up from the heat
I'ma play it how it go
Be down to the finish
Fuck havin' friends cuz friends turn into your enemies

Load it up slide it in cock it back pop it out
Load it up slide it in yall die
Load it up slide it in cock it back pop it out
CMB226 we all ride

Money and bitches don't mix
Hoes shit got a lotta niggas fixed
That's why I stick with blood thicker than water shit
Me and my brothers split keys
Get me 18 ounces nigga, and 10 g's
Ridin' in convertible Rolls Royce with the HB's
Draped with diamonds and gold hoes love me
Fuckin' right nigga I raised the B.G
That's why I'm a hot boy on these city streets
Blood thicker than water I know you feel me
Set trip motherfucker we gon' kill ya
Change on ya brain
Let's sneak and then peel ya
I walk light
Uptown
But I still got my ghetto stripes
I creep and peep
Keep my hand on my heat
I ain't gon' let no bitch nigga steal me
I got a world
My main ho pregnant with my lil' girl
I gotta be here to serve her world
Motherfuck snortin' furl
Gimme the rap game lil' dick suckin' bitch and I'ma stay rich
But it's yo' world
Guess what Cash Money Records stick together like blood and furl
It's just me and you all
I'm with whatever you wanna do all
Let you floss in my new car
Pop a nigga for you fall
We deal with niggas ass together
Build up all our cash together
Scored our first bag together
And stole our first Jag together
No separation
No outsiders could come between us
2 felonies and misdemeanors got a subpoena
Turnin' state
The Hot Boys carry they weight
Any false movin' the case then the fool losin' his face
Look what we been
Though we did it sin
I'm prepared to do it again
I ain't lyin'
My bloodline is 1 of a kind
Fuck it we all shine
Look and we all blind
This shit is turned bad yeah
You done fucked with my people now I'ma bust ya ass yeah
Wodie, leave that alone, let that go
Best to respect my click or check that ho
We shine like Grandma
Don' waxed the floor
Blood thicker than water don't you ask no mo'
Load it up slide it in cock it back pop it out
Load it up slide it in yall die
Load it up slide it in cock it back pop it out
CMB226 we all ride

Blood thicker
Water slicker
And ain't no nigga
Slick up in my click
The 226 it consists of true niggas
We move ya crew be cool or lose nigga
Now I dig
Up in ya blood for my blood
My click thick
And you can't separate bloods
Now when you ride
Ready to die who you with
Yo' real family or some niggas you fool with
Now on you' side, do you really have love
Boy we click tight stick tight that's blood
And guess what
We marchin' a million strong
Terrorizin' you' section black connection is my home
Love is the key
Outsiders can't keep
14 givin' my whole life to CMB
I'ma represent it
Solja rag, Reebok tennis
Stick to click called 226 to the finish

Blood thicker than water that's why my niggas they harder
Comin' in that water
Off top they grab the choppers and chop
So nigga you better play solo
U get fucked the fuck over
So don't explain to me nigga
Talkin' bout shit that I should
Shut yo' mouth cuz I don't wanna hear it
Off top that trigger get pulled
Puttin' yo' head on flat
Caught slippin' layin' on that back
Niggas spotted you creepin'
Them chopper bullets start releasin'
Niggas wonderin' why you wet
They found ya dead in the projects
Have people cryin' and thankin'
But yo' body been stankin'
On the ground 16 holes
Shot up head to ya toes
Blood all over ya clothes
Don't fuck with me no more
Now they know
I ain't no ho
They backin' up that CMR come up in that water

Load it up slide it in cock it back pop it out
Load it up slide it in yall die
Load it up slide it in cock it back pop it out
CMB226 we all ride3Embed
