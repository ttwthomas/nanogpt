77 ContributorsBack to You Lyrics
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you
And I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you, back-back

She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like a drive-by, I'm real, these niggas sci-fi
But that's neither here nor there, she been contemplatin' short hair
She said she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoein', but she the only one worth knowin'
And yeah, I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'm a dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, "Okay, I'm your honor"
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass, I just be like, "Come sit your groceries on my counter"
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana
I'm dying to meet her girl, but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9
The weed is funky, but I'm smelling fine
Tunechi

Now, I know (Woah!) the only compass that I need (I'm putting my hat back on)
Oh, is the one that leads back to you (She said)
Now, I know the only compass that I need (Yeah)
Oh, is the one that leads back to you

Uh, I got that shit in my system, somebody gon' be my victim
Eh, so where you at with it? 'Cause I can't do it by myself, I need a ass-sistant
I got that good-good, that get right, that early morning, that midnight
I beat it up like a fist fight: one, two, three, four, five, 6-9
That dick all in your windpipe, some of her friends I dislike
Some of your friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one, don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue, my third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind, girl, can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi

Now, I know (Woah!) the only compass that I need (I'm putting my glasses back on)
Oh, is the one (Yeah!) that leads back to you (She said)
Now, I know (Now, I know) the only compass that I need (Get to me baby)
Oh, is the one (You need to get to me, baby) that leads back to you
(I'm waitin', yeah)
Uh, should I call somebody else?
'Cause girl, it's almost 12 and this dick won't suck itself
Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
If you said you on your way, ayy, ayy
Should I call somebody else?
'Cause girl, it's almost 12 and this dick won't suck itself
Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
I just hope you know the way
And she said

Now, I know (Woah!) the only compass that I need (I'm putting you back on)
Oh, is the one (That's right) that leads back to you (And she said)
Now, I know the only compass that I need (Get to me baby)
Oh, is the one (You need) that leads back to you (To get to me)
That leads back to you
(But you already got to me)18Embed
