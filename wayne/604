57 ContributorsThrow It In The Bag Lyrics
She all on me 'cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentley coupes
Got no needs, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
All—All—All—All—All—
All we do is shop until we drop
Right there in the floor
She all on me 'cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentley coupes
Got no needs, she got me (Yeah!)
Buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop (No Ceilings, baby!)
All—All—All—All—All—
All we do is shop until we drop
Right there in the floor

Okay, swimming in Polo, sleeping in Jordans
I bought her cell phone and I don’t even much call it
New imports make her feel important
No bullshit, nigga, no Ben Gordon
Get her information, take her on vacation
Give her dope dick; now, she under the sedation
Wake her in the morning, breakfast where she slept at
Tell her, "Go shopping"; I can't wait 'til she get back
Louis flip-flops and a pair of pink sweatpants
She wear that on my jet, I fuck her after jet lag
I take her to the vet 'cause she a bad bitch
You can't be broke and happy, so, me—I'm mad rich
I'm talking Young Money shit, she love the way I think
L’Oreal all over my bathroom sink
Betsey Johnson all over my bedroom counter
My pockets too deep, I fuck around and drown her, Weez'!

She all on me 'cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentley coupes
Got no needs, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes (No Ceilings)
All we do is shop until we drop
All—All—All—All—All— (Yeah)
All we do is shop until we drop
Right there in the floor (I got you, baby)
She all on me 'cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentley coupes (Hahaha)
Got no needs, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes  (No Ceilings)
All we do is shop until we drop
All—All—All—All—All—
All we do is shop until we drop
Right there—

Okay, fucking on Versace, napping on satin
I love to hit it backwards: call it Pig Latin
I bought her ass a Mac, now we be iChatting
Niggas swag-jacking, but I got my patent'd
Fr—Fresh out the salon, I took her to Milan
I speak a little French, and hers is no better then mine
I pass her the blunt; she probably hit it one time
Catch us at the game, sitting on the baseline
We can call a timeout, take a lil' time out
Pockets too deep, shawty, you gon' have to climb out
Faviana prom dress with your spine out
And I live on the beach—you can get that panty line out
She wants to own me, and I ain't tryna fight it
She said it's her dick, she got it copyrighted
And I don't pay for pussy, because her pussy priceless
I go fishing in it, and I ain’t a Pisces
Ugh, Gucci only to the grocery store
Stop playing, bitch, we balling like Okafor
Ha! And now, we headed to the dealer
I'm gon' cop my baby something with no ceilings, ahh!
She all on me 'cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentley coupes
Got no needs, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes (You dig?)
All we do is shop until we drop
All—All—All—All—All— (Hahaha)
All we do is shop until we drop
Right there in the floor (No Ceilings)
She all on me 'cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentley coupes
Got no needs, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes  (Young Money)
All we do is shop until we drop
All—All—All—All—All— (Young Money)
All we do is shop until we drop
Right there on the floor (Gone!)5Embed
