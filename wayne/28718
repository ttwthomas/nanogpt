4 ContributorsAround the Way Girl LyricsOkay I saw you at the bus stop
You had on a halter top
And your mini skirt
And your Dooney and your Bourke
So I turn around and scooped you
Hit you with that toot toot
Like do you need a ride
Like do you need a ride
Because I know where you're from
You're from where I'm from
And I'm with you girl
I know you girl
I like you girl
I want you and I'm from where you're from
And I'm cool with your mom
And I like you girl
I want you girl
I'm with you girl
I'm for you girl

You're my around the way girl, oh
You're my around the way girl, oh oh
You're my around the way girl, oh
You're my around the way girl, oh oh

In that new Benz drop
Lookin' at that Benz drop
So I brought you that Benz drop
And now you in that new coupe
Hit me with that toot toot

Like girl I need a ride
Because you know where I'm from
