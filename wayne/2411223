1 ContributorTunechi (Intro) Lyrics

You hear that nigga? Yeah
That's my motherfucking drank
It's Tunechi
That's right
It's that motherfucking Nelly mixtape mane
Shout out Zaytoven
I think I'm the young Beethoven
Truthfully
I don't know
The wait's over, yeah
That right
I ain't doing shit mane
Smoking on the motherfucking fat ass back wood
Thinking 'bout a fat ass bankroll
You thought I was gonna say a fat ass, huh?
Huh, most of them aren't real anyways these days, yeah
But I ain't trippin', not me
I pay for it
That's that ass, I mean when I say I pay for that ass
I don't mean I would pay for some pussy or that ass
I mean I would pay for that 
You know what I mean, Fuck...You might also likeEmbed
