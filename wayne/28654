20 ContributorsPresident Lyrics
Uh, yeah, yeah
Hot Spitta, Spitta, Fly Society
Young Money y'all, Young Money y'all
Yeah

Figured it's time that I step back from the game
And peep it from a coach's point of view, so I can see
How niggas went wrong and how the players was wrong
And I can do it how a pro supposed to do
No mistakes allowed, you get caskets for that shit
The line of scrimmage is waiting
Niggas is blitzing, you could get sacked quick
Drop back like an all-star QB
Or the top on that high-end sports car with two seats
You niggas don't comb the pages of the duPont Registry
Looking for vehicles and accessories
Like I do, and every representor of my crew
I get love from Cuz and the Piru
Slide through the drive through of a fast food restaurant
Turn the music down and tell the broad what kind of sauce I want
Scratch off quickly to a main street, intentions to make cheese
Let the windows down and let the purp' scent clear out
The police is peeping me and they don't think that I can see
I know they gon' pull me over and make me get out
But I'm on to 'em
Spray the chronic-killer and talk calm to 'em
"Good day officer, what's the problem?"
You looking for answers? I don't got none
I'm from New Orleans and New Orleans don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, I'm getting money nigga
You might also like
Haha, I know that's right
Hello world, yeah
Yeah, uh-huh, Music to Fly To coming soon, y'all

You can see me on the Eastside of New Orleans with a red bitch
Fuck the world, make it walk with a leg twitch
Flow retarded, I'm on some Special Ed. shit
The magnificent, twist it like a dread, bitch
And I can get up in the car and drive
And if the record is a smash, I can still survive
Yeah, money ain't a thing but everything to me
Shit, I gotta make them C-notes sing to me
Yeah, higher than all of the angels be
And, no I never choke but I strangle beats
And, I am just a player in this game we be
So go blame the referee, don't complain to me
And I used to have a cutlass on stainless feet
Passin' all day up Latoya's Street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Had me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedaling my ten-speed bike
Who knew I'd be pedaling the six-speed white
Big dog through the yard where the little dogs bite
So if you are female dog, you don't fight
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga, I got all my masters
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga...2Embed
