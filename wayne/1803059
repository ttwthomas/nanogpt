3 ContributorsNo Ceilings Lyrics
Ok, pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
I say pop that pussy and shake that ass

And no ceilings

Bout to go pecans, i beat it like 3 hands
Weezy in the building you other niggas freelance

Fuck with young money bitch nigga get hit up

Where the muthaf-cking beef gets deep fried nigga
Nigga couldn't see me with 3 eyes nigga

On the mic I'm like pac, Im like B-I nigga
Whoever don't agree come and see my nigga
I be waiting in my mansion seaside nigga
Young muthaf-cking M-O-N-E-Y …

Hate no, hate no
I dont wanna hate no, hate no
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
I dont wanna hate nobody tonight
I dont wanna hate nobody tonight
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
Everyday pushing me, pushing me

Ok, Cool n Dre
This is no ceilings
I do this all day I got bars, no railings
Looking for a bitch for some sexual healing
Open up her mouth and she catch it like Braylon
Young Weezy F, the F is not for failing
Swagger just dumb call it Sarah Palin
If you niggas fly then I must be para-sailing
We are not the same, Im a muthaf-cking alien

Back on my saddle with the tool and my hand
Uptown real nigga bitch landed in the sand
Back home nigga did it for the land
For the grand with the money with the tool in my hand
High life, give a fuck about your stripes homey
Killer kill, kill a spend your … daily homie
Turn left get your switch turned of nigga
Turn right and get your shit took off nigga
Fuck cos we higher than we ever been
More loaded, white doves, burning hundreds
Overseas nigga pitching on the top floor
High floor situation from the bottom floor
Born in the middle, shining like a diamond
Red diamonds, big diamonds how we roll nigga
24's fucking all these hoes nigga
High life getting money then we go nigga
Like father like son boy…
