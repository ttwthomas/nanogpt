10 ContributorsDifferent Girls Lyrics
Nu Jerzy Devil
Hahahah
Amy
Young Mula Baby (hahahha)
So many girls under the time
Weezy you ready?
Let's go

I'm a flirt
I'm a pro
I'm a Freak
I got a different girl everyday of the week

I get it popping everyday I got a new chick
Booty Suzie going right with the white six
Lil Keshia love role play but I'm a beast
Looking at her body thinking, "boy I'm 'bout to feast"
I love women but shit I love money
Make it rain in the strip club like a dummy
I ain't got no game they know my story
Homie roll with game and he wear a lot of jewelry
You lazy women bore me your baby mama call me
Little pig fucker so they call me John Coffee
See a flock of women i'mma run through 'em softly
Don't know what you doing get your dirty mouth of me
I want a girl with a name like yummy!
Love giving brain till her nose gets runny!
I want a sunday to monday bunny!
Bring your own girl I dont care if she chubby!
You might also like
I'm a flirt
I'm a pro
I'm a Freak
I got a different girl everyday of the week
:
I'm a blood I'm a roll I'm a G
In a different world outerspace with a freak
But that don't mean neptune on the beat
Cause it's Nu Jersey Devil from Blackwall street
Weezy f baby from young money baby
Like the easter bunny baby wanted my candy
So I gave her my lollipop then she made her body pop
Then that made me kinda hot
I'm lying that made me sauna hot
But please stop sweating me
Women scream "get in me"
And what do I do I get in it
I put on my boot and I step in it
Right left in them Mr. Eterceden head all the time
It may sound crazy but I got head on my mind
Lay it on the line or just lay it on carter
And yeah I hear you screaming but my name ain't harder
Hah! Girl I'm nasty I do my thing and they coming for me like lassie
I'm a flirt
I'm a pro
I'm a Freak
I got a different girl everyday of the week
:
I'm a flirt man I really don't care
I tell the women whatever they wanna hear
Mommy I'm balling I'm so sincere
Is that your home girl sitting right there
She can be my monday
You can be my tuesday
After shorty done I can squeeze ya'll in two days
Three is not a crowd I don't care what you say
My women come in twos like shoes with a cute face
My girl gotta girlfriend her girl gotta girlfriend
Bring her to the crib i'mma show you how run it through
Little man in the boat here come the serpeants
Slide your body down the pole and let me see you twerk it
I'm with my thursday junk she a real freek
A hundred grand fitting right up in her butt cheek
Mrs. Friday go weezy cause she's just running
But saturday be having Mr. devil so strugglingEmbed
