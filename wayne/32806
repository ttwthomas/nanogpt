Aye
(I want a soldier) Well, you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' Impalas around
(I got a soldier) Wit' the top down, feelin' the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin', your thighs ridin' harder than guys
Wit' the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them lames be spittin' at you, tell 'em "don't even try it"
To shoot it with 'Chelle, and kick it with Kelly, or holla at B
Ya gotta be Gs, you way outta your league
Please!

We like them boys that be in them 'lacs leanin' (Leanin')
Open their mouth, their grill gleamin' (Gleamin')
Candy paint, keep that whip clean and (Clean and)
They always be talkin' that country slang we like
They keep that beat that be in the back beatin' (Beatin')
Eyes be so low from their chiefin' (Chiefin')
I love how he keep my body screamin' (Screamin')
A rude boy that's good to me, wit' street credibility

If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he better be street
You might also like
We like them boys up top from the B.K. (B.K.)
Know how to flip that money three ways (Three ways)
Always ridin' big on the freeway (Freeway)
Wit' that east coast slang that us country girls, we like
Low-cut Caesars with the deep waves (Deep waves)
So quick to snatch up your Beyoncé (Your Beyoncé)
Always comin' down, poppin' our way (Our way)
Tellin' us that country girls the kind of girls they like

If his status ain't hood (Ain't hood)
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he better be street
I know some soldiers in here
Where they at? Where they at?
They wanna take care of me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here
Where they at? Where they at?
Don't mind takin' one for me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here
Where they at? Where they at?
They wanna spend that on me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here
Where they at? Where they at?
Wouldn't mind puttin' that on me (Where they at?)

Next to the speakers, keep a toy in the trunk of the 'lac
A reformed D-boy used to run into traps
Still a soldier, go to war if you runnin' your trap
About my girls, ain't no thing to put ya under the map
Walk the streets, five-deep with nothin' less than a stack
And 80 carats on my chest provides a special attraction
50 Gs in my jeans, plus the dough from the white
It's a reason I'm the king
Girl, I know what you like, c'mon

If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood (Ain't hood)
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if you lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he better be street
I like them boys over there, they lookin' strong tonight (Strong tonight)
Just might give one the phone tonight (Phone tonight)
Homie in the dickies in my zone tonight (Zone tonight)
He don't know it might be on tonight (On tonight)
Ooh, he lookin' good and he talkin' right (Talkin' right)
He the type that might change my life (Change my life)
Every time he look at me, my girls be like (Girls be like)
That one may be the one tonight

If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood (Ain't hood)
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he better be street

Hey, see, Cash Money is a army
I'm walkin' with purple hearts on me
You talkin' to the sergeant
Body marked up like the subway in Harlem, call him
Weezy F., baby, please say that, baby
If you don't see me on the block, I ain't tryin' to hide
I blend in wit' the hood, I'm camouflaged
Bandanna tied, so mami, join my troop
Now every time she hear my name, she salute!

I know some soldiers in here
Where they at? Where they at?
They wanna take care of me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here
Where they at? Where they at?
Don't mind takin' one for me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here
Where they at? Where they at?
They wanna spend that on me (Where they at?)
I know some soldiers in here
Where they at? Where they at?
Wouldn't mind puttin' that on me (Where they at?)15Embed
