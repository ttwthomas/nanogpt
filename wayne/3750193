17 ContributorsBlood Pressure Lyrics
Frank
Yes Sir
I'm tired of fallin' back
So what you want to do?
It's time to put the pressure on theses niggas
Yeah, I think it's that time
Let's get 'em

Flame thrower, we be scorin', we be reppin'
'Til the game over
I'm a bitter rap legend in a Range Rover
Put the 6 and the 7 up my blessings
Mess with us, precious, so check his vitals
North Philly icon, built for survival
I'm a don, it be wine everywhere that I go
You're damned for the gold but the Thobes is from Cairo
When God made me, he broke the mold, nigga
I ain't with the nonsense, nothin' with the doctors
Thought he was a boxer so I smoked him like a rasta
I could tell he was a nuisance, always like to do shit
Thought he was a shooter so I tagged him with the Ruger
I know Hov, I got the blueprint
Black Panther party how we move like Huey Newton
Eat my beef without the gluten
Can't compete with all you losers, watchin' from the bleachers
It's confusin' how we eatin' but it make you throw up
You might also like
I see you hatin, all that love better
The boy gettin' mad, check his blood pressure
You see a nigga shinin', check his blood pressure
All that anger that's gon' give you high blood pressure (Blood pressure)
What you talkin', check his blood pressure
You see a nigga stuntin', check his blood pressure
You see a nigga winnin', check his blood pressure
Ya boy sorry, better check that nigga blood pressure

Hollygrove, that’s 17, no L-I-E, I’m L-I-T
I’m the Y-M-E, K-I-N-G, B-L-O-O-D-I-N-G
I’m O-U-T H-E-R-E with my G-O-O-N-Z-Z-Z
We T-O-O D-E-E-P
I gave a bitch 3 wishes, she wanted me, me, me
Bloods like pressure, that's you on a stretcher
These bitches too extra, charge you extra for the pleasure
I got killers in my section, protection on protection
We catch you, interception, and finesse you in a second
I got tattoos on my texture, bad news when I touch ya
We kidnap your girl, we need that Ke$ha, we molest her
I’m a nigga with aggression, attitude erection
Pressure bust pipes but not this fuckin’ blood vessel
Let my niggas come test you, suggest you call rescue
Go to war with one pistol like a fuckin’ scud missile
All you see is blood tissue, guts, liver, God bless you
Tunechi, I’m special, so special, no pressure, motherfucker
I see you hatin', all that love better (See you hatin')
That boy gettin' mad, check his blood pressure (Check his blood pressure)
You see a nigga shining, check his blood pressure
All that anger that's gonna give you high blood pressure
Blood pressure, what you talkin' 'bout, blood pressure (Check his blood pressure)
You see it, it's nothin', gotta check his blood pressure (Check his blood pressure)
You see that nigga with it, check his blood pressure (Check his blood pressure)
Your boy sorry, better check that nigga blood pressure

Rolls Royce strafin' on 'em
Two steppin' on 'em (Better check that nigga)
Me and Tune slide through, put the pressure on 'em (Ugh)
These dudes punch drunk, get the breathalyzer (What)
They came strapped up but we left it on 'em (Bah-bah-bah)
Smith and Wesson on me
Keep the weapon always (What, nigga?)
Rep Philly, niggas really ain't got nothin' on me (Philly)
All these trappers turned rappers, they bore me (Fuck 'em)
Here for the glory, they got nothin' for me (Uh)
Your boy sorry, the term icy, the car hop (Yeah)
Pullin' type of stalkers, we on top, you are not (You not)
We are worldwide, we in the streets, and we online (Online)
Then we make a lot of money when we tour spots (Lotta money, lotta money)
This new Rothschilds and this Young Money (Yeah)
Before this rap shit, we pump blocks (Yeah)
Though we gon' keep gettin' bucks 'til the buck stops
New Rothschilds and the Roc got it locked
(Blagh-blagh-blagh)
I see you hatin', all that love better (I see you hatin')
That boy gettin' mad, check his blood pressure (Check his blood pressure)
You see a nigga gotta check his blood pressure (Check his blood pressure)
All that anger that's gonna lead to high blood pressure (High blood pressure)
Blood pressure, what you talkin' 'bout, blood pressure (Blood pressure)
You see it, it's nothin', gotta check his blood pressure (Blood pressure)
You see that nigga with it, check his blood pressure (Check his blood pressure)
Your boy sorry, better check that nigga blood pressure
