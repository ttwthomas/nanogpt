11 ContributorsI Will Not Break Lyrics
When I pull up, voices in my head
Got the weight of the world restin' on my back
I've been doin' alright, I'm doin' okay
Just gonna catch a vibe, man, I'm on my way
But I hold it down now
'Cause I don't wanna let you down now
Even if the lights go out, the Sun won't shine
Middle finger to the world, give the glory up to God
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Everything I have done
Makes me what I am

I do what I want, I sing what I want
I never give in, I never give up
I walk through fire, feelin' no pain
Just let it all burn now, let it all break
I'm a survivor, that's what I've done
I'll never go back to where I came from
I will not stop, I will not break
I will not break, I will not break

I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
There's rules to the shit, follow 'em or laugh at 'em
I'm writin' you from an island, I know it should be silent
But it's louder than a violet, I'm lost but found a wallet
Hope I find myself inside it, I've been lower than an eyelid
But it ain't about where I've been, it's all 'bout how I got here
And a home is still a home once it's on fire, that's how I live
So I'ma drive the Hot Wheels 'cause you can't take me where I will
I'm outchea
You might also like
Everything I have done
Makes me what I am

I do what I want, I sing what I want
I never give in, I never give up
I walk through fire, feelin' no pain
Just let it all burn now, let it all break
I'm a survivor, that's what I've done
I'll never go back to where I came from
I will not stop, I will not break
I will not break, I will not break
Yeah, yeah

Everything I have done
Makes me what I am

I do what I want, I sing what I want
I never give in, I never give up
I walk through fire, feelin' no pain
Just let it all burn now, let it all break
I'm a survivor, that's what I've done
I'll never go back to where I came from
I will not stop, I will not break
I will not break, I will not break
Yeah, yeah
Everything I have done
Makes me what I am1Embed
