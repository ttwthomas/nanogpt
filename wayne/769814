Good afternoon call me young tune im DOPA you all
In one spoon New Orleans law layer USA tax payer
Rapper slash rocker jazzy like a jazz player but im
Ask player you can ask players I don’t got stacks
I got layers I out-layers get your scale up married to
The game pick the bill up and kiss the game goodbye
Yall dry im Mr. Potato head to you small fries (yeah) you
Can check my archives and they nickname my swagger
Sharp knives (uhuh) first name my thoughts wise last
Name carters to rappers im jaws 5 last name carter
To rappers im saw 5. Young Mula BabyYou might also like1Embed
