53 ContributorsSweetest Girl (Dollar Bill) Lyrics
Some live for the bill, some kill for the bill (Yeah)
She whined for the bill, grind for the bill (Whoa)
And she used to be the sweetest girl
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill (Yeah)
And she used to be the sweetest girl
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill (Whoa)

High school, she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed
Go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in the wrong car
Bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (where my money at?)

See, I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
'Cause I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)

Pimpin' got harder 'cause hoes got smarter
On the strip is somethin' they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club, shakin' for a dub
Get triple times the money and spendin' it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low
'Cause 25 to life's no joke
To all my real guerillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women's gettin' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry
I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
'Cause I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
It drives the world crazy
Weezy, she used to be…
And she used to be the sweetest girl!

She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Whatever, now she like sour amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she ask him: "Where my money at?"
See, I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
'Cause I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)

Some live for the bill, some kill for the bill (Yeah)
Where my money at?
She whined for the bill, grind for the bill (Whoa)
Where my money at?
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill (Yeah)
Where my money at?
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill (Whoa)
Where my money at?14Embed
