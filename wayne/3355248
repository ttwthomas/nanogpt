On God, Dedication 6
On God, Dedication 6
On God, yeah

25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And, bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful when you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrian

You bought a car for the bitch
I buy the narcs for the bitch
You buy apartments and shit
It's nice, I just walked in this bitch
You buy the art for the bitch
Y'all argue too often and shit
You always startin' some shit
That should come off of the bench
Shout out my homies I miss
Nino and Tony and Mitch
This ain't no cordial shit
She wan' come snort all this shit
She wan' go hard with a bitch
She know what happens today
She know we always forget
And she just posted the shit
And he just saw his lil bitch
Tell him I want him to trip
Tell him my guns gettin' skinny
Tell him they're starvin' for this
Give me the check, give me the throne
My hair is a minute too long
My bitch look like Vivica-Berry
Your bitch look like Rosetta Stone
I made my bitch go get a clone
Fuck 'em together and then on they own
When they catch feelings, I’m gone
I'm whippin' the Winnie the Coupe
I'm drivin' and sippin' the soup
The shit made me drift in the coupe
As long as I get to the stu'
Ruler clip, Rick the Ruler slick
Pull up on your bitch, you just called your bitch
Got that "Who is this?" She don't know you exist
She on her Mula shit, that's that truer shit
Make you eat your words, make you chew your shit
Then we knockin' out every tooth you pick
Nigga, fuck you, and fuck who you with
Yeah my bitch broke, but her booty fixed
Wait, I just popped a Perc, another for dessert
I washed it down with syrup
I just left planet Earth, ran into Captain Kirk
I pop a Perc, I'm trippy, call me Perc Nowitzki
Just call her Lewinsky; blurry, blurry vision
Blrrp— "Hello, who is this?" I just hit the line
I got a bitch in mind, I call her anytime
She taller, but it's fine, together we 6-9
I hit her other line, he like, "What other line?"
She like, "Never mind," and she can tell a lie
And I can tell she's lyin', that's no lie
That's my awesome lil bitch
Got me a saucy lil bitch
Got me a bossy lil bitch
Left her for a bossier bitch
It cost me a arm and a dick
I got me a naughtier bitch
She suck on the balls and the stick
I'm about to play golf with the bitch
I'm way on Mars with the bitch
She fuckin' with Martians and shit
You shoppin' at Marshall's and shit
And yeah, your bitch gettin' trippy with me
Want a quickie with me
Say she wish that I had Nicki with me
Say she'd lick her with me
Wish you wish I had my nigga with me
Bitch, you washy-wishy, y'all can't trick me
She said "God, forgive me"
I say "Nah, I'm busy"

I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 bank accounts
Plus a main account, with insane amounts
That's somethin' to think about
Plus the drank in route, now I'm hangin' out
With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 bitches ready to drink me down
Ready to drink me down, ready to drain me out
Plus my main in town, and she came around
Said they ain't her style

25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful when you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrians
(Err!)

Six shit, on God
Dedication 6 on God
Dedication 6 on God
That's some sick shit
Oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Yes Lord
Dedication 6 yes Lord
Dedication 6 yes Lord22Embed
