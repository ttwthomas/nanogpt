3 ContributorsGangsta Lyrics
Boo got a blunt in his ear!
Chea, it's me and Raw D.I. this time, bastards
I got my little brother Capo on this one, too
Yeah, haha, that's right
Young Money, Cash Money, man
(Yeah, real shit nigga)
Gangsta shit, get your game up, boy, for real

The clock is ticking, the cops is sitting
Waiting on me to pop the ribbon so I can get locked in prison
But I forgive 'em, they don't know I got the bishop
Giving me a future face, they cannot prevent it
Sky's the limit, I travel but I tries to pivot
Look in my eyes and combine the spirit, time'll end it
If it's not a couple of Gs, it's dimes and pennies
If I don't break a knuckle or knee, my shine is finished
I'm climbing in it, but I could fall down the chimney
A hound is in me, so don't come around or near me
You clowns is really fucking up, ya bound to get it
I sit a barrel on ya tongue so round and pretty
Fought my ticket, now I'ma skip town and kick it
Dress code: just some khaki brown lil' Dickies
Got them pounds and chickens stuffed in coffee grounds and fishes, nigga
You might also like
It don't get no gangsta than this
Fucking with them gangstas, I guarantee
Shit gon' get real gangsta, my nigga
And you gon' back down, and you gon' back down
It don't get no gangsta than this
Fucking with them gangstas, I guarantee
Shit gon' get real gangsta, my nigga
And you gon' back down, and you gon' back down

Yeah, fresh off the block, that's Apple and Eagle Street
I go through there every week even if it's just to speak
What up?
I don't see Red, so I keep going
He's probably with Rodney, or probably with Roney
I go by Trill Rill cause he be up in the morning
See, that's that penitentiary shit and he been out for a minute
But I'm up!
Birdman keep asking me to stick
22s on the Rolls and I keep telling him no, but
If he keep playing then I'ma have to show him
And come through this bitch on 24s
Like what up?!
These hoes keep asking me to marry 'em
Knowing that my ex-wife'll bury 'em
So bitch, shut up!
I'm blowing on that berry like Marion
You knowing what the fuck a nigga carrying
Get bald head like a Aryan
I think a nigga bout to buy a Marriott
Now all my hoes, put up!

Check, lights off, mask on, creep silent
Move light, walk, step, talk, squeak, holla (I hear 'em)
Pull a tool, nigga sweet like peach cobbler
Shoot twice, don't check, let them people find him
I'm the screw face to this rap game
Weezy put me on, new face with the same name

Oh yes I did, get 'em, kid, if I ask ya
Just bring me the bastard with his head unfastened
Faster than a panther goes the lead from the clapper
Round up ya boys, get this round of applause

They say I'm two faced, look, nigga, I ain't changed
Cause if I feel played, I'ma let the iron rain
Rrrang, bang bang with my gang, mane
Know how to slang 'caine, whoa, I can maintain

Bang bang, cross my chest
Bang bang, you cross ya chest
Toss ya chest in the mess with the rest, damn

Yeah, light one up, man
We gon' ride out to this one, yeah
Yeah, stop playing, we so here, man
Hats low, money high, we high too
Fuck bitches, it's Young MoneyEmbed
