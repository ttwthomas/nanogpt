I got the game mad, and I ain't talking about homie in LA neither
I say I got so much money man I don't know what to do with it
I was thinkin bout gettin some and lettin u spend it
Hey I do it way bigger than u did it
I'm sitting on them jordans, it must be the shoes in me
I get real ignorant
Cruel really cruel
When it rains just tell em to get in the pool silly
Who really pourin with us?
Home boy you trippin u gunna fall and bust your ass
I can rap fast but I like slow better... why?
Cause bitch I'm a flow better fl-y fl-y fly
With no feathers
And if you want know bad u gunna know better yea

Haha ya'll really don't want me
