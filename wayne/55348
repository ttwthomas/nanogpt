6 ContributorsUr Supplier Lyrics
Hello, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
What's hatnin'? Trey Songz, I see you, homie
Weezy, let's get it

Anything I want I can buy it
That's why I always keep bad women beside me
I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplier
All day long the fiends callin' my phone, ring-ding-dong
'Cause they know I always got that fire
I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplier

Yeah, I'm a supplier
Call me Marlow 'cause I'm off the wire
Yeah, I'm on fire
Say that he's king, well he's a God damn liar
Tell me what he do, tell me where he be
Got what you want, I got units in the streets
In the streets and I ain't talkin' CDs
Shoulda been a locksmith the way I handle them ki's
I ain't talkin' 'bout Alicia, but I play with them keys
You know I ain't Sonny Bono but I play with them skis
Yeah, I play with them skis
And if you want to buy some it'll cost you some cheese
You might also like
Anything I want I can buy it
That's why I always keep bad women beside me
I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplier
All day long the fiends callin' my phone, ring-ding-dong
'Cause they know I always got that fire
I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplier

Extra, extra, hear all about it
Made huge stacks of money, countin' 500,000, half a mill
And I ain't lyin', I'm way too real
I got diamonds round my neck like a baseball field
I married Snow White 'cause she make me cream
And this is not a fairy tale, I made a D-boy dream
I'm the hottest right now, I'm gonna blow a cold wind
There's a blizzard in my city, yeah the A's snowed in

Anything I want I can buy it
That's why I always keep bad women beside me
I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplier
All day long the fiends callin' my phone, ring-ding-dong
'Cause they know I always got that fire
I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplier
Ahem, like hey lil mama
He can spend money but we can spend a day lil mama
'Cause I'm a rider, but I can be that much more like a supplier
Shawty, I can carry you like Mariah
Me little homie, I'm just sparin' you like a tire
I'm tryna tell her
He can buy you the bar, Ill buy you a wine cellar
He could leave you tomorrow and I could fuck you forever
Now what you think about that?
You could fuck around and get a ring about that
Just think about that
So pretty, all I do is think about that
And that'd be you
Oh, but we can turn back to me and you
Park my Lambo in your heart
And when it comes to supplies, call me Mr. Wal-Mart

Anything I want I can buy it
That's why I always keep bad women beside me
I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplier
All day long the fiends callin' my phone, ring-ding-dong
'Cause they know I always got that fire
I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplierEmbed
