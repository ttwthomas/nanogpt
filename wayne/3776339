(Verse)
First off I'm hotter than a motherfucker
I represent that dirty like a blood puddle
I shut them haters up like a dog muzzle
I be the ace when the cards shuffle
It go pity-pat-tonk {?)
Apes and gorillas Got from grape to vanilla
A lake or a river Play with a nigga
I make it a slumber party you can lay with your nigga
Mr. Tough Thug don't start with me
I am a painter and blood is an art to me
I piss on you guys you's a wart to me
And your girlfriend still report to meYou might also likeEmbed
