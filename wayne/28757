14 ContributorsMoney in the Bank Lyrics
Money, I'm paid (blast off on these niggas)

I got money on the drank
And half on the dank
(The greatest DJ in the world), (east side)

Yeah, thank god I'm a millionaire
Hard body, these other boys teddy bears
Fuck with me momma, I know you want a G
And I'm a real blood, if you want R&B
Just call me Carter honey, if you can't say the baby
Bitch I'm so fuckin' hot, I feel radiated
Ho I'm so fuckin' fly, my eyes are aviaters
I'm stuck at the top floor in the elevater
Cause I'm high, dumb high
Nigga, I could look into the sun's eyes
Young guy, but rich though
And I keep a rag on me like a 64, like a 64
You know I got that bounce
It's mister-quick-to-pour-a-eighth into a 20 ounce
Okay I'm Terminater, you niggas Minnie Mouse
And I'm Young Money, anyhow
You might also like
I got money on the drank (drank)
And half on the dank (dank)
(Mack Mizzle)

It's hood shit baby, so you know it's all thug's
Rockstar life, lotta sex and alot a drug's
It's OG Kush, purple dro and kind bud
Have a real nigga feelin' like he's so fucked up
Have a fake nigga feelin' like he's so bucked up
There go the weed man, spitta back the truck up
There go the lean man, thugga we done lucked up
I mix the two dro by my bitch and then we rough fuck
I leave a Crego to the lot and pick a Jag' up
If you was in my shoes, nigga you could brag cuz
Weezy Wee got me, Baby he got me
Young Money, Cash Money, bitch that's my posse40. cals with brokes, safeties just try to rob me
Million dollar man Ted DiBiase
Now let me tell you, if I'm missin' a bush
Shit'll get ugly than New York from the Flavor Of Love

I got money on the drank
And half on the dank
(The greatest DJ in the world), (east side)
Now we lean (lean) out our minds (out our minds)
Rest In Peace to DJ Screw, we on the grind (on the grind)
Cause we lean (lean) out our minds (out our minds)
Rest In Peace to DJ Screw, we on the grind (on the grind)1Embed
