So they ask me
"Young boy
What you gon' do the second time around?
How you gon' come back?"
I tried told 'em
"I come back like 32
I jump back like 33"
Ugh, hit me
That's nothing
This is Tha Carter II, people
This is Tha Carter II, people
Hey

They call me Mr. Carter, I kissed the daughter
Of the dead's forehead, I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers, gracias
I'm crazy, yes, it's obvious
Going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulder and a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffing, I'm just pitching, your honor
I ain't snitching, your honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter
Open the cabinet, close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet, drop a four in the bubbles
I remember being young, tryna hustle my dope
Tryna tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Tryna tell you 'fore you jump that my MAC ain't broke
You ain't tryna see how far that black back lane go, no
Call me Pac-Man, your ghost is blue
I got my Red River rubies and my ocean blue jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating, but I got a tapeworm in my tummy, oh
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm, no warning, nothing
Look, it's morning, no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up tryna take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 504, you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me, bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army, Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me, but I still be here
No chrome on the Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil', crack the roof, and roll up the windows
And my hood love me, they tell me bring it home
That's why I holler Hollygrove on each and every song
You leaping at a dog, a dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa, I'm talking 'bout Stunna
He like, "Keep your dough," he got your ho
And the sun shines on the king and sets on the prince
I met the Birdman and I been shining ever since, like thatYou might also like20Embed
