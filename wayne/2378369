That girl got you too too excited
That money had you too too excited
Them cars had you way out your character
That jewelry got you way out your character
Them girls got you way out your character
This fame got you way out of character
This flow got you way out of character
I showed you love now you way out of character

I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known

I should've known you would cross me
Because I'm on and I'm saucy
And now I'm gone and you salty
Steam coming from your head like a coffee
My reality is better than your dreams nigga
My ho pussy hole is wetter than your dreams nigga
My ho legs spread wider than your wings nigga
Put your head in a microwave, DING! nigga
You out of character, slime, you out of character
And me I'm out of patience, sick and tired like Malaria
These hoes like mosquitoes
These niggas trying to be hoes
What happened to that boy and I ain't Pusha T though
Supa where the cup at
I'm working on my comeback
The girl I'm with got much class
But she got a dumb ass
I keep a money bag, a drug bag, and a gun bag
These niggas ain't even shining, making the sun mad
Rappers in my lunch bag
Me and Future have a food fight
Bedroom full of new dykes
Old green and new white
That's old money, that's new coke
That's Young Money, that's 24/7, 3-6-5
That's Cash Money; I'm like "Who ho" Who ho, who ho!?

I should've known you would cross me (Yea who ho?)
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em kudos)
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em adios)
I should've known you would cross me (I'm on my patio)
I should've known you would cross me
(Thinking about Hollygrove)
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em adios)
I should've known you would cross me (Yeah)
I was looking in your eyes you ain't built like that
(You ain't built like that)
You ain't built like that (I should've know)
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me

They say I ain't a rapper I'm a trapper
I be with the robbers and the killers and the kidnappers
I'll fuck your bitch in your crib, watch the kids after
Still fuck a bitch, fuck the ring, motherfuck a pastor
I don't, I should've known she ain't really love me
I should've know she just want to fuck me
I fucked up, don't judge me
I got this money and I ain't turning down
This money'll turn your life up but bring your family down
Some of the closest niggas to me, they don't come around
Cause some of the closest niggas to me, I'll gun 'em down
For real
I should've known you'd cross me
I'm from the hood, that's where they taught me
Go hard until they off me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I got some niggas that was there
That ain't no longer there
I don't care
I don't cry about it
And I barely get sleep anyway
I should've known you would cross me9Embed
