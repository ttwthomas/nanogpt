Blinded by the light (Yeah)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night (Yeah)
Blinded by the light (Skull Gang)
Blinded, (Young Money) Blinded
Blinded by the light

You see my chain glow, follow that rainbow
I can put bangles around yo ashy ankles
I hope you get the picture, like Kinko's
That I love you overall, like paint clothes
Baby, Wayne knows what you like
Now baby gon' shine, cause you bright
And me plus you equals too bright
Baby they gon' be

Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Blinded, Blinded
Blinded by the lightYou might also likeEmbed
