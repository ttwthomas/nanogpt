Mr. 305 checking in
It's the remix
Kent Jones
Must feel good to have a worldwide hit, huh papito?
This is, another one!
Welcome to the club
We The Best Music!

Keep telling me this
And telling me that (Yes, Lord)
You said once you take me with you, I’ll never go back (Moolah baby)
Now I got a lesson that I want to teach ya (And this is)
I'ma show you that where you from don’t matter to me (This is the remix, baby, yeah)
She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?, she said "Konnichiwa" (This is the remix, baby)
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame" (This is the remix, baby, yeah)
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule" (This is the remix, baby, yeah)
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all

I'm surrounded by Caribbean queens
I'm talkin' Cubans, Puerto Ricans and Dominican things
I got Jamaicans and them Haitians, no un poco santi
I got them Trini's and them Bajans and they all for me
Let's not talk about the woman down in Mexico
Yeah they pretty but they could be cartel on the low
So ten cuidado, down in Brazil, they got booties for real
Those Colombians are stunners, they got looks that could kill
She told me, “Ay papacito, ay mi rey"
She said "De dónde tu eres? I wanna stay"
I got my money for sure, got my passport for sure
As soon as she hit the bathroom, I hit the door
I'm gone (Woo)

Bonjour mademoiselle, je m'appelle Lil Tunechi
Might want cover your ears, cause Young Moolah, we boomin'
I'm a savage, I'm a beast, I have sex on the beach
And my ho speak foreign, and my plug speak foreign
I pull up in something foreign, my bitch light orange
I'm rockin' Ralph Lauren and some Chucks like Norris
And these other ducks boring, and my bucks foreign
Codeine in my urine so I'm snoring and ignoring
When she–

Telling me this

No matter where I go
Lord have mercy, I can't help but keep it G
Grab your girls if you with them
If you ain't take the keys and go and get them
While you at it get your mom so I can thank her for your courage
'Cause you got them family genes and I love the way you fit 'em
She don't wanna leave, why? 'Cause I'm a true religion
Tell your friend to be my guest, and if she smart she know the rest
I had way too much Belaire, and I'm quiet sure you can tell it
To be real I forgot your name, so I'm askin' how you spell it, you keep

Felicidades
This the remix
And this is the remix babe
It's We The Best epidemic, epic! (This the remix babe, yeah)
Another one
