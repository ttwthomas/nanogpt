3 ContributorsRap Cemetary LyricsSkull gang
Yea
They ain't prepared
So they scared
They know if I don't feel 'em then I'm a kill em (kill em)
I see dead people (dead people)
And they bout to get buried
(In my rap cemetery)
I see dead people (dead people)
And they bout to get buried
(In my rap cemetery)
I see dead people (dead people)
And they bout to get buried
(In my rap cemetery)
I see dead people (dead people)
And they bout to get buried
(In my rap cemetery)
Uh
And here rests the beast
And if you wake it then you rest in piece-s
Disconnect ya neck and feet
They bury you today and find ya head next week
Uh
My flow nasty like ya baby mama
I got two balls, I pass em to ya baby mama
I be swimmin all backwards in ya baby mama
I will make the kid a bastard kill ya baby mama
Wait this were supposed to be about rap huh?
Well let me rap now
Bitch I'm the best to ever do it, they don't knew it how I know it
F*ck the newest, f*ck the oldest, I'm the coolest, I'm the coldest
I'm the hottest, I'm the baddest, I'm out of this stratus
Fear not a thing but God
F*ck you, f*ck pride, f*ck eyes
Cause y'all niggas can't see me, say the F Baby after the Weezy motherf*ckers
I see dead people (dead people)
And they bout to get buried
(In my rap cemetery)
I see dead people (dead people)
And they bout to get buried
(In my rap cemetery)
I see dead people (dead people)
And they bout to get buried
(In my rap cemetery)
I see dead people (dead people)
And they bout to get buried
