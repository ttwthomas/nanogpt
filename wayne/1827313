7 ContributorsHustle LyricsYeah, just like priceless
Something you can't see, nigga
Ya see times is hard as it is
That's why I got girls and my girls got kids
And all I wanna do is handle my biz
And all I'm tryna do is whatever I did
Every day I been prayin' to you
I hope you hear everything that I'm sayin' to you
I get money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Nigga, I don't trust a soul so I ride alone
I keep my eyes in my rear-view ridin' home
See, I'm ready for whatever, understand me
Any situation, whatever the Lord hand me
We pull guns, you niggas don't pull a damn thing
The only thing you niggas pullin' is a hamstring
Roll the dice, man, we kill time gambling
W-wintertime, top down, nigga real arrogant
Big Money, so we blowin' it apparently
C-Cash Money, Young Money, yeah, it's all a family
Birdman and Weezy, they payin' all salaries
And I'ma ride with 'em till they bury me

That's why I got girls and my girls got kids
And all I wanna do is handle my biz
And all I'm tryna do is whatever I did
Every day I been prayin' to you
I hope you hear everything that I'm sayin' to you
I get money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Livin' that life, livin' that life from under dem streetlights
But it ain't bright enough to show me where I'm goin'
But I still find my way and when I do I keep goin'
And uh, a nigga wit strikes
Try me and your family don't sleep right
Didn't think I was tough enough to make it on my own
But I can get through anything if I done made it through the storm
And uh, now I'm killin' at night
Killin' that night-life on the east side
Leather on chrome
Television with the phone and the top is so gone
Ya see times is hard as it is
That's why I got girls and my girls got kids
And all I wanna do is handle my biz
And all I'm tryna do is whatever I did
Every day I been prayin' to you
I hope you hear everything that I'm sayin' to you
I get money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Yeah, flash the bright lights, nigga, smash on site
Born rich, bitch-nigga, live with no wife
Keep the pain of the price, prices with the dice
Give a fuck about your life rollin' railish stripes
High like a kite, G4 every night
Overseas money, bitch, we do it so right
Don't do it right so we don't it all
Money hard, bitch nigga playin' like a ball
Ball life, ya head life, ya gettin' getcha game right
Ya paid the price, hit ya up and laid you right
Twist ya life, nigga, we live in sunshine
5-star condo and stay fly
Ya see times is hard as it is
That's why I got girls and my girls got kids
And all I wanna do is handle my biz
And all I'm tryna do is whatever I did
Every day I been prayin' to you
I hope you hear everything that I'm sayin' to you
I get money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, moneyEmbed
