3 ContributorsA Dedication (D3) Lyrics
Yo, this is the dedication to the bitches. And to the women, ya dig? A bitch is a female dog, and they say a dog is a man's best friend. Alright, now, so, I just wanna say to all the ladies... I— I— What you gotta say? Yeah, I just wanna say to all the ladies that we love y'all. And all the single mothers out there, keep your head up when you do what you do. You do it well And shout-out to my mother. She's a wonderful mother. And everybody else's mothers. And everybody in this room mothers. Shout-out to all our mothers, ya dig? We love all y'all. Happy Mother's Day, even when it ain't. Without y'all, we wouldn't be here. Yes. That was a beautiful dedication, right there, to the women. Shout-out to my daughter. Your daughter, too.You might also likeEmbed
