9 ContributorsDrip (Remix) Lyrics
Calm down, bow down, draw down, fire rounds
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip...

Leave a hater drippin like a muthafuckin faucet
Let it ride sideways, and bust my tool offset
Leave these suckas leakin like a hole in a boat
Then I turn them to a cancer patient, holes in they throat
Toss his body off the boat, let 'em float off shore
Before he hit the bottom, I be chillin' on the golf course
I guess you call that hole in one
Catch 'em at the daycare, I kill 'em holdin' his son
It's like a horror movie, catch it at the cinema
Plug 'em like an enema, he drippin like chlamydia
I see you administer IV's, I be to sinister
Get rid of 'em, diminish 'em
Sit 'em in front of the ministers
So I suggest you watch your words like a teleprompter
I got hella choppas like folks that's in helicopters
Pop 'em, Orville Redenbacher when the straps out
Nigga sees his chest drippin, watch that pussy pass out

Calm down, bow down, draw down, fire rounds
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip...

Suwoo to the beehive, strapped like T.I
I keep that bitch on me, like "The Book of Eli"
I just shoot 'em all, so I don't have to decide
Split your body up, they gotta bury your ass three times
Run up in your house, leave your brains on the couch
Shoot up everything, fuck is aimin about?
Empty that clip, then that bitch slide out
Continue that procedure till them pussy's dried out
I'm a east side gangster, I ain't never been a buster
Nina is a cold black bitch, but I trust her
I don't need a psychic to tell me I'm a hustler
Cause bitch, I'm all about my paper, like Usher

Calm down, bow down, draw down, fire rounds
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip...

I got guns like I want it
Assassin like 100, but this ain't no fuckin movie so you pussies don't want it
Have you sick to your stomach like a rollercoaster would
I'mma tell you this, this adventures of the hood
All bull shit to the side nigga, I'll blow your ass off
Young nigga shit, I do it with my mask off
Crack's dumb as shit, yea I'll fuck around and crash ya'll
Rich nigga shit, be the first nigga to run out
Once I bring them guns around, everything change
Pussy ass niggas start actin so lame like
"I don't want no problem, I won't look at ya chain
I won't talkin bout ya dog, I don't even know ya name"
Call me cocky, back in the day, I'm Mr. Rubberband
Mr. cook it out the frame, true
And you? Mr. You-should-be-ashamed
And disrespected a G, you'll be Mr. Leakin-out-ya-brains
Calm down, bow down, draw down, fire rounds
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip...Embed
