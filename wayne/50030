13 ContributorsShe Bad Lyrics
Met shawty up in Urban Outfitters
She killin’ these hoes now I’m murkin' out with her
Shit, I’m just tryna work it out with her
Got a gym at the crib, now I’m workin' out with her
She heard about me
She heard of my niggas
She heard about you and she heard we out did ya
Yeah, you know what I’m talkin' bout nigga
If her pussy is a house then I’m a house nigga
She bad

Yeah K-I double D
Got the baddest bitch like Trina with me
Yeah, my shawty bad, got them other hoes mad
She tell em get glad handle zip lock bags
Bad girl I’ma leather whip your ass
Have a seat in my detention class
Slam like Michael, jam like Michael
Man, shawty bad like Michael

Met at the mall, walked in the store
Told her hi, buy it all
Your boyfriend creep but baby I crawl
You got some pretty feet
Hello, how you doing, she said she doing fine
Where ya baby daddy, she said he doing time
I said that's cool, she said that's not
She said I’m cold, I said that's hot
Cause she bad
Cause she bad
Cause she bad
Cause she bad
Cause she bad
Cause she bad
Cause she bad
Cause she bad
Cause she bad
You might also like
Cause she bad to the marrow
Gone til tomorrow
I get to the point keep ya eye on the arrow
Your boyfriend is zero, I Rob his DeNiro
I ride rims wide and my tire's very narrow
My, I’m so fly like an eagle
Ask yo bitch, she reply like an echo
Yeaaah, and I'mma have to rehab
If I keep fuckin' with baby girl
Cause she bad
Cause she bad

I told you she the baddest
Look at her ass standin' out it’s outstandin'
And she nasty to say she married him
Mother ain't Marge but she suckin' like Maggie
And I’m hood, I want you on top of the hood
You one bad ass lumberjack handlin' that wood
You too bad, tell me whats good
Not bad meaning bad but bad meanin' good

Because she’s too bad
She too bad
And she probably got a nigga in love with her
That’s too bad, I don’t care
Cause she bad, cause she bad
Cause she bad, cause she bad
Cause she bad, cause she bad
For President electioning, represent
Shawty can’t be heaven sent
Cause she bad, but we had a good time at ?
Now she sad cause I’m gone gettin' back to the cash
But its back, she’s bad, cause she bad like we bad
Now she glad cause we back and he mad cause she glad
Like yeeeah

If I keep fucking with baby girl
Like yeah and I’mma have to rehab
If I keep fucking with baby girl
Like yeah and I’ma have to rehab
If I keep fucking with baby girl3Embed
