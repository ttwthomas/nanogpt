Catch me departin' from New Orleans out the first class department
Seat back screw driver out the glass I'm gulpin'
Leavin' the gulf and
Headed to the west side
LAX Cali sex be the best right?
So they say so I go
So let's see, flew my 64 with me
Sunsest notice me, Whaddup?
Holla at Grape Street hit the hood up
There in the Denali and I breeze through the valley
But it's breezy in the valley
Blew 50 on the Lakers then I made the 50 back
Next day I was in vegas just
Ballin' up the strip me and some legal prostitution
Stop hatin' on a pimp the new Young Wayne Newton so
Go to Oakland where I mostly be smokin'
Got a bitch in San Francisco where she mostly be locin' so
Tomorrow I'm east coastin' yes I am
Baby just be there when I land, So many places

We just traveling people..... That's all
(I've been so many places)
So many places, here and there, up and down, down and up
There and here (Haha)
(In the Eaaaasst)
In the east people
(Weeeessttt)
All the way to the west side
(Nooooorthhh)
Up north holla north and south and the east

Yall know thats my part right there (right there)

And I'm so jiggy man (jiggy man)

Plus when I fly commercial I'm selected
My east coast nigga got that hersey I'm connected
On speed boats straight from Albuquerque I'm connected
Drop down in jersey, drive to Manhattan
Cop a few jerseys out the Bronx outta Sammy's
Then I tell the driver hit 5th Ave for my darling
Tell my driver drop me and the homies down in Harlem
Mommy on, 145th say she dyked out
Well get it while the gettins' good cause tonight I'm out on to
Beamtown, bet I'm Celtic green down
Hit the chicken wing spot hood rats scream now (Ooo)
Out to Illidelphia for romancin'
But my muslim ho fastin' so I
Go to B-More be more nasty
And she be there when I land (Ha-ha)
