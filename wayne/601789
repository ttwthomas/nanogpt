Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, "Yes, I suppose"

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, "Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end"
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you
You might also like
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, "Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end"
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you
Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, "We did it"
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writin', this is The Pinkprint

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go363Embed
