5 ContributorsSmoke Session Lyrics
Damn I can't believe she left me like this
I mean I brought her to the airport but I can't believe she jumped on the plane and left me like this

And I would leave but I had to take a minute in the smokin section
Tryin to let the pain ease
Watchin her plane leave
Trippin in the smoking section
Tryin to regain me
How can I get a grip when I lost my main squeeze
And now im stuck inside of an ashtray
Like a cigarette
But my heart pumps gasoline
And this she know
I just crashed and burned
Now here come the smoke

Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
I gave myself a hour to sit at the gate
I booked us yesterday flight 378
U think I gave him enough time to change my mind
I love him but I couldn't this time
I packed it all up in my two bags and one carry on
U would think I was sure but it feels so wrong
A piece of me is strayed over still with you
I guess ill smoke my last stuck wonderin what I should do

Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Im like hold on whats up
Shorty what u goin for
She packed up
Dipped out
Now she left me all alone
Back up in the smokin section
Damn she got me really trippin
Weezy tell me what u sippin
I f**ked up on this situation
Please pass me a cigarette
My nerves back calm down
She always used to promise if she leave she'll be back around
I guess its sum things as a man that im missin
So at the end of the night u can find me in the smokin section
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
Whats left u'll find it in the smokin section
Find me where u left me burnin in the smokin section
Up in smoke
What's left you'll find it in the smokin sectionYou might also like1Embed
