23 ContributorsYFS (Young, Fresh, Shameless) Lyrics
Young, fresh and shameless, young, fresh and shameless
About to body slam the beat, Love Wrestlemania
Love miscellaneous, fuck instantaneous
I'm busting nuts in her mouth, young macadamia
Young, rich and famous, young rich and famous
Young Money but the money so fuckin' ancient
Buy wine, drink it, by God, amen
Can't forget to thank him, young, fresh and shameless

Back to it, waste no time
Black Uzi, Draco, 9
Back room smokin' bomb
Got to feel me, pour the five
Black mamba, Kobe Bryant
Snake eyes open wide
Rat poison, you know why
Hair trigger, no salon
Can't lose, in overtime, hit Miami for LeBron
Swam through whole Ocean Drive
Smoke a stick, porcupine
All these bitches want be mine
Yeah she lit I blow her mind
Look at how I make all these looking ass niggas roll they eyes
Go retarded on them, Tunechi
Openhearted on them, Tunechi
I'm the father, I wear the pants, I'm talking Corduroy or blue jeans
Smoking harder on a doobie, holy water running through me
Polariods are tryna shoot me
I am Nino, you a pookie
You might also like
Young niggas famous, my young niggas go in
My OGs are no different, identical twins
1-7 amen, that's my set, amen
Can't forget to thank him
Fuck these hoes, I blame them
Young, fresh and shameless, young, fresh and shameless
Bout to body slam your bitch
Lord, Wrestlemania
Young, rich and famous, young, rich and famous
If you hating on me you can tongue kiss the anus
Bigger picture painting, fine art framing
Don't forget to hang it, fine wine drank it
Turn a trap house to the wine house, Amy
My God, amen
Don't forget to thank him
Don't try to play him, your whole squad be dead men
We pull up in the AM, toast, waffles, bacon
More fiyah blazin', the chopper sound Jamaican
I stay armed like a cowboy
Troy Aikman

That's a Polo blanket, she under it naked
I'm under influences, got me overthinking
Got me syrup drinkin', popping Percs to painers
Niggas talking about they gods, they just Kirk Franklins
And my dreams are so big, feel like the Earth's shrinking
I wake up and chase my dreams, catch 'em and detain 'em
Still the best rapper alive, still the steel is stainless
I feel like the Yankees, boy my hittas can’t miss
Young, fresh and shameless, young, fresh and shameless
About to body slam your bitch
Lord, Wrestlemania
Love miscellaneous, we fuck instantaneous
I'm busting nuts in her mouth, young macadamia
Young, rich and famous, young rich and famous
Young Money but the money so fuckin' ancient
Buy wine, drink it, by God, amen
Can't forget to thank him, young, fresh and shameless

Young, fresh and shameless
Stevie, Mula, yeah
Got me syrup drinkin', popping Percs to painers
Niggas talking about they gods, they just Kirk Franklins
