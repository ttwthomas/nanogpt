10 ContributorsTuesday & Thursday Lyrics
Two of the hottest days of the week
They harassing and hacking niggas in that UPT
N.O.P.D. be rolling so deep, they be fucking over niggas
Kicking in doors, sometimes they be pulling triggers
Ya hustling? Better chill out, 'cause they not for joking
Making sure they close shop, all day, they gon be smoking
So I advise you just to stay inside
If they catch you down back, for sure you taking that ride
Downtown, rilla where niggas doing time, be waiting
Better be bout your issues, for your ass they gon be chasing
And every man for theyself in that pen
So if ya all in nigga, ya all in
For help, ain't there nigga, ain't no calling
So if ya got a chance, run when ya hear that siren
Tuesday and Thursdays, they gon be riding
Stay ducked off cause it's safer when ya hiding
And they don't give a fuck what shape and sizing
Lock you down, prison rate steady rising

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look, them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look, them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
You might also like
Shit, nigga better hop, skip, and jump from the block
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, better run from the block
Stay there if you want and get stumped from a cop
Knowing them white folks, you might get hung from a cot
Look, look, look, look, look
Nigga better run
If you got some dope or too much cake or a gun
Looking for some freedom, find that you will get none
And damn, I ain't even much see my P.O. last month
I'ma play the hotel
I missed my court date, I ain't trying to end up in jail
I'ma put up some mail in case I have to make bail
I'ma still rhyme swell, shit, might as well
And stay from the block cause it be hotter then hell
I'ma tell ya now, they don't give a damn about ya
End up in that place and fool around and be forgotten
They rotten like a whole apple off a forbidden tree
On Tuesdays and Thursdays you won't find me

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look, them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look, them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
ATF be showing they ass around my block
Feds get all the respect cause they close shop
Who do you think be pushing them birds up in the hood?
Who do you think be dumping them bodies up in the wood?
It's something like baseball, three strikes and you ride
Violate your probation, two and a half on five
My pride don't want me to be up in this place
My pride don't want the law to notice my face
A young nigga with golds behind tints on dubs
And the paper license plates, they gon think I'm a thug
They gon tear this motherfucker up looking for drugs
And make them dogs break me off, trying to get me to talk
You wouldn't believe the shit with the police I done been through
I done seen some shit they did to people I'm kin to
My friends too, that's why I be chilling, ya heard me?
Up in my fucking residence on Tuesdays and Thursdays

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look, them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look, them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street

Certain days lil' B. Geezy hit the block and hang
Two days out the week I lay low cause them people gon swang
I ain't bout getting hacked, you know that ain't my thang
Police riding my back, scoping out my rang
I play it smart, I ain't stupid, I know when to leave the block
I know how to peep the scene, I know when it's hot
Oh them jumpout boys, they'll take your loot
Tuesdays and Thursdays, them big white boys have a nigga spooked
They be three deep, creeping
Coming round the corner, peeping and sweeping
But they ain't gonna catch me slipping, I'm rolling out
I'm gon' chill by a bitch and cool out on the couch
Smoke blunt after blunt till I pass out
When it get dark and cool off then I smash out
I respect the task force, they don't give a fuck
For anything, they'll have ya in central lock up, on Tuesdays and Thursdays
Whoa, now there you have it. Tuesdays and Thursdays
Off the heezy, the whole task force for yo' ass
Nigga just giving ya some game, ya dig? For sho
Them white folks don't wanna see a nigga ball, they wanna see us crawl, bruh
For sho', lookee here
On Mondays, you can run all day
On Tuesdays, sit ya ass down (duck out playboy)
On Wednesdays, you can slang all day
On Thursdays, sit ya ass back down (off top!)
On Fridays, you can fuck all day
On Saturdays and Sundays, you cool boy, believe that
You can take this for what it's worth, playboy. And don't use ya brain
And take heed to what CMB be saying. Fuck around and be in that cage like a
Ol dog. Treating a nigga like a puppet. Taking orders like a bitch. But a
Nigga gotta use that game and stay up and try to stay rich man4Embed
