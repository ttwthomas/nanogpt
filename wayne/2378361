Yeah
It's Baby E. on the track
Yeah

Said
Trappin' getting old, so I been moving weight
Pigeons in the trunk, I'm on the Interstate
Made myself a plug, get it a hundred ways
And I still got the Act' you know I love the taste
Spending dirty money at the Gucci store
Fuckin' with the models, eating sushi rolls
She think I'm a rapper, get that groupie love
Baby mama mad, she see me movin' up
On to bigger better things
Bigger television screens
That I never get to see
'Cause I'm so heavy in the streets
I just blew a hundred thou'
So I'm goin' outta town
And I'ma try to make it back all right back

Finessin', finessin', I be finessin'
Finessin', yeah, finessin', I be finessin'
Finessin', yeah, finessin', I be finessin'
Finessin', finessin', finessin', I be finessin'

Ballin' in this bitch, I put my partners on
Tie you up and make you call your baby mama's phone
Tell that bitch to bring that bag, oh lord we need that bag
Xannies in a plastic bag, call that a sleeping bag
On MLK in a Bugatti, I feel free at last
Percocets, Molly, and Syrup, I got PMS
Chillin' with your bitch watchin' First 48
And I still got that Act', you know I love the taste
And I let her hit the J
And I let her call me bae
And I let her call you back
Just to get that out the way
Then she hang up in your face
And I get it on her face
Then I teach her how to skate
Then I skate
I'm straight

Finessin', finessin', I be finessin'

Me I'm on, I'm just on my finesse shit

I'm just on my finesse shit, finesse shit
I'm up right now, yeah
Hit the streets in my best shit, my fresh shit

All my girl got is some heels and a lil towel on9Embed
