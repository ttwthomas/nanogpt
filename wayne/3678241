4 ContributorsNo Mercy Lyrics
One for the hurt, one for the heal
But one from the hammer'll get a nigga killed
Fill a nigga up, then this for real
We gon' hit a nigga up, and split a nigga meal
Yeah
If niggas actin' how they feel-
Then I pull it out the jacket, get to clappin' like a seal!
Yeah
Kidnappin' the lil ones
Throwin' bitch niggas off the back of buildings!
I hope you know how to fly and sincerely
I would do the same thing to everyone you live with
Everything you stand for, I send 'em to the heaven's sky
Weezy F. Baby, boy get it right everytime
I hope you know how to fly and sincerely
I would do the same thing to everyone you live with
Everything you stand for, I send 'em to the heaven's sky
Weezy F. Baby, boy get it right everytime

Water whippin' in dishes set from the last supper
Bought the kitchen, now religion's in the crack muscle
Thought your bitch had a vision- Until her back-buckled
Now she can't sit down, she only Half-Humble!
(Hold up, Hold up)
Splash in it- belly flop
She wanna Cum my way, no Fetty Wap
So I put her on a girl for a couple of days
Made 'em scissor till they came, called it Cut N' Paste!
I ain't hard to find tho
Got a couple Rollies for the Same you buyin' Time Fo'
Got a 50 that'll reach into your timezone
Wet 'em up, 'till he nothin' but a dry bone!
See my arrow's out, till the Quiver-End (Quivering)
You ain't heard this kind of beat?- it's different
Wayne's PH4DED, We made it Pussy, I'm in again-
Throw a little salt in the wound, then pour the liquor in!
