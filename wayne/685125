46 ContributorsAdmit It Lyrics
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

Woah
She say, "I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
I saw some pictures of you boo'd up, it looks like you're starting to like 'em skinny"
I say "Girl, you a trip," she say "I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'"
She say "Watch these hoes, 'cause they leeches like Robin" I say, "No, Robin Givens"
She was sittin' on my lap and you know a nigga strapped, I know she feel it
It's crazy out here, I'm just protecting myself, you know I'm winnin'
She say "I get it, and if anything was to happen to you, I'd be livid"
"You ain't gotta worry 'bout that, I'll kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit"
Come up missing, think they caught a big fish 'til his body come up drippin'
I treat her legs like like a grand opening, smiling while I cut the ribbon
I took a pill, she took a pill, we was chilling, 20 minutes, now we feel it
She say "I know you probably hear this shit a lot, but you the shit in my opinion"
I said, "It never gets old, thought I'd never say never, but I did it
She say "Who you kidding, boy? You like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
I admit it, big booty, big titties; I admit it

I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back
You might also like
I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry
Then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable

Okay, I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
Saw a flick of you boo'd up, boy, you never liked 'em skinny
You tell me I'm a trip, well, I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'
I'm just sayin', oh
Boy, this here will keep you warm at night
Feed you good before you catch a flight
Stop actin' like you ain't got no type
Who you kiddin'?

I admit it, yeah, I admit it
But I got these guns on me right now
I got these drugs on me right now
I got the Feds on me right now
I got two buyers, want it right now
She took her clothes off and I stopped
Looked at my watch, like "Fuck it, why not?"
Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord
She say, "I know you thought that you was about to get a quick fix, hit it, quit it
But you know you ain't been with a good, thick bitch in a minute"
I say, "You ain’t never lying; thought I’d never say never, but I did it"
She said "Speaking of a line, are you finished? All we need is a witness"
"Girl you trippin', young nigga still livin'"
She said, "Who you kidding, boy? you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
I admit it, I like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties; I admit it
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry
Then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable14Embed
