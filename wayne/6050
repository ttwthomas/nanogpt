Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Uh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Yes)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Miss Lopez, uh um)

Hi, I'm Tune, the man on the moon
I live on the beach, get the sand out your shoes
And all of that changed since I met you
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom
Young Money

You got me and I could not defend it
I tried, but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spellbound
Let me no other choice but to get down

It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, ah
It's too late, tell 'em
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it
You got it, ah
You might also like
When I look into your eyes, it's over
You got me hooked with your love controller (Yeah)
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah (Come on, ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy, I'm into you)
I'm into you (Ayy, I'm into you)
I'm into you, yeah (Uh)

Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Yeah)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh

Listen, now I'm strong, baby, I bring the fire on
Sharpshooter, you can call me "The Zion"
I'm not the one easy to get to
But all that changed, baby, when I met you

It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, come on
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it
You got it, yeah!
When I look into your eyes, it's over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover (Why?)
I'm into you (Ayy, I'm into you)
I'm into you (Ayy, I'm into you)
I'm into you, yeah (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy, I'm into you)
I'm into you (Ayy, hahah!)
I'm into you, yeah

Okay, now I'm into you, like you never knew
I'm falling for you, baby, I need a parachute
Pussy so wet, I need a wetsuit
You're way too fly, I could be your jet fuel
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me
It's too late, it's too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race, ha!

When I look into your eyes, it's over (When I look into your eyes, baby, yeah)
You got me hooked with your love controller (I know)
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover (Come on)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you, yeah, baby, yeah (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah (Ayy, yeah)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Yeah)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Yeah)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Yeah)
'Cause I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you, yeah, baby, yeah (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah7Embed
