7 ContributorsNo More Lyrics
No more lying friends
 Fuck 'em
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go
X2
 You can't doubt what I got, and if you do you can't go where I go
I'ma go by myself, I come in by myself, so I guess it's all about me and it's fuck you

Come on home biscuit,for man's sake
No more fake hugs and handshakes
Stand straight, you sweeter than a pancake
Me, I'm trying to get that green like the landscape
As for my team, originate
See what I gotta say can't wait
I demand cake
Gotta eat, keep the family straight
They all holding out they hands and plates
Yeah, Wayne's from a place called Hollygrove from the bottom of the globe
Area code 5-0-4
Be hero Joe and I zero in with the Eagle and there'll be no him
I don't need no help, I don't need no homie
I don't need nobody - nigga, I got money
Nigga, I got heart to go along with the guns
Call me Weezy F. Baby, I be by myself when I cum, yeah
You might also like
I don't need 'em, I don't need 'em
I don't love 'em, I don't trust 'em
So mothafucka I was born by myself with my dick in my hand
With my mind on a million dollar plan
Now baby, you are looking at the million dollar man
And I'ma die alone, so alone I stand

Dudes that never spoke to me now wanna speak 
Girls that never said a word now wanna creep 
Guys that never ran with me now wanna be 
The only passenger in my coupe with two seats
Damn, what is it Holmes? Ya boy's breath soft
Air fake, I can feel the silicone
You're all a bunch of Pamela Andersons
Me, a family man, I take care of the family, man 
And it seems like my day one niggas ain't acting like day one niggas
I ain't changed, I just came up, niggas
And trust me when I say I ain't put the streets down or them things up, nigga
Bring the Phantom through the hood, I ain't fronting on y'all
Just tryna let you know it's bigger than the corner, my dog
I ain't playing basketball, but I'm ballin' for sure
Now back to the money, catch me when I come off tour 

The rims may offend you on the shit I slide into
Fuck you, send ya to the desert, tell ya be cool
Ahem, hold on the pistols
Roll by the cops and turn up the stereo
Sittin' at the corner, lookin' like a owner
Talkin' to the owner, yeah my price goin' up
All in the strip club, never get a boner
Only get hard for dough, I'm Homer
And you're a Simpson, and I'm a pimp, son
And she ain't comin' to the crib 'til her friend come
We gettin' money over here, you need to get some
Out comes the cold steel for my income

Out comes the cold steel for my victims
Born alone, die alone, but you could die with them
Cars white and sexy like Nicole Kidman
Bad chick by my side, video vixen
Ya might fly to L.A. just to shop at Kitson
Thousand dollar hoodies, I'm pickin' up about fifteen
That's about fifteen thousand, I'm trickin'
Zero on bitches 
Swarovski crystals, Great China Wall
And my money run longer than the Great China Wall
And my pockets is Mediterranean Sea deep
So keep plotting and praying to get me
