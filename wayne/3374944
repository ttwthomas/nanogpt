15 ContributorsGo Crazy Lyrics
Yeah (yeah)
I'm reloaded yeah
Young Money
Maaan

Main mission: get plenty bands
I ain't never been a minute man
I ain't never been a cheese eater
Yall looking like Packers fans
Hollygrove, that's Pakistan
AK, that's a half a man
Let it rip, they ain't have a chance
Won't make it to the ambulance
YM double O, we the business
Up in traffic with me the nigga
You ain't Stevie, you see a nigga
Slick side, won't be a nigga
I ain't been up in the city lately
Bitches say I'm acting shitty lately
Got me working off of two phones
Got this rap shit going crazy
I don't really like to waste time
Grab that from the waistline
Make it boom like a bassline
Long flights through a grey sky
I was chillin' on Biscane
Got a text about the dick game
From my bitch out in NY
Tryna take me to the Knicks game
Ain't it crazy how shit change
Ain't it crazy how a bitch change
One week you they MCM
Next week you a big lame
Yall hoes crazy, yall hoes childish
All my partners, they tote choppers
Drink lean out the whole bottle
She juggle balls, she a globe trotter
White girl want a coke shower
More money that's more problems
More caine I sold out it
Doors open it's so cloudy
I gotta juice, ready for take off
Sending hits they talking Adolf
I'm a pit, I'm talking J dog
What the fuck, I'm at the A loft
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
Business busy I ain't finna call you
Blowing up know you feeling awful
Blowing up know you feeling awful
Been thru old hoes i got new flames
On snakes alley I blew flame
 on magic city I fuck good at these new thangs
That's all facts all true
One call and I fall through
Niggas broke sitting inside sending out tweets that's what yall do
Woo, I'm good in the South, West, and the Eastside, how about you?
How you "good" but your niggas throwing up the peace sign? That's a foul move
Let's get it
I'm on that bullshit you ain't wid it
All my bullshit, you can get it
Fuck on the baddest bitches in the city
And it dont matter nigga, any city
Please dont compare me with none of these niggas
Don't run with these niggas, don't ask me for pictures
I'm counting the dough and I'm laughing at niggas
And trapping they bitches they handle my business
You say we fucked, ho you liar
Dont give a fuck ho, you can die
I throw my middle finger in the sky
Then put a middle finger in ya twat
I done bought hope to the whole block
Won't stop till i get a whole lot
Open up and yall niggas come shop
Roll up and watch then I roll out
Wait, go crazy
Yeah, go crazy
Man, go crazy
Damn, go crazy

(Naaah)
(Go brazy)
(So brazy)
Blood gang big B's red
I'm a packers fan I'm a cheese head
Got a yellow bitch and I'm a green head
I'm a sleepy head cause I'm a weed head
I'm a hammer head when her knees spread
Walking like I'm talking till my teeth bled
Till my feet red I'mma need meds
I'mma need mines I'mma need theirs
I'm a blind head I'm a bleach head
She a xan head she a beach head
I'm the sandman when her dreams dead
She go ham ham on a meathead
Like Batman in the sweet coupe
Like Pacman with a sweet tooth
I got both hands full of sweet bread
For the big heads, we be head you
Flatbread on your last leg
Your check book on the last page
And with that said I'm on a rampage
I'mma teach you and your classmates
No weekends off no half days
I'mma sashay on your landscape
I'mma get two hoes, make a pancake
I'mma fuck 'em both through their back gate
But can these hoes fix a backache
I come on they chest, straight checkmate
Then they hug each other now thats great
Then come together like the USA
Hollygrove is our set Jay
Tunechi, I am the Sensei
Money Money Money Money team hit the funny team with the trick play
Touch down celebration
Wait, go crazy
Yeah, go crazy
Yeah, go crazy1Embed
