Lite it up

Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Shots leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Shots leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Shots leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga
Shots leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga
Shots leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga, yoga

I can’t fuck with ho niggas
I can’t trust these hoes neither
Wake up early in the morning
Eat that pussy like cold pizza
Hater ass niggas be baller blocking
Acting like some goalkeepers
There’s a reason for everything
But my niggas kill for no reason
Camo shorts with a ho beater
All-black hoodie, I’m Grim Reaper
Look like its time for spring cleaning
Brand new spanking street-sweeper
Been in the game, I’m knee-deep
I like good head, I like good reefer
All my niggas strapped and ready
To set it off, Queen Latifah
Got a chopper with a drum
Split swishers with my thumb
Get money like Donald Trump
Double barrel on that pump
This Kush I got ain’t no chump
Get stupid and get stomped
Two guns I call ‘em Kriss Kross
Kriss Kross will make you jump
Gotta do what a nigga gotta do
Got goons, I ain’t even gotta shoot
Got a bunch of bad bitches by the pool
I like my bitches in two’s
Gotta go, I stick it and move
G-code, I stick to the rules
Last night I got so high
I swear to God, I went to the moon
I’m on that shit you can’t get nowhere
You pussy boy, don’t go there
If I don’t do nothing I’mma ball, no hair
Smoking on that “oh yeah”
My niggas tote that hardware
What you ’bout woadie?
My niggas about that warfare
Real nigga since day one
Cause I ain’t promised day two
Throw that pussy at me
Bitch I think I’m Babe Ruth
Drop top Maybach on the way
Yeah that’s that new Landaulet
She let me into her jungle
I’m gonna hit her with that rattlesnake
Guns clap like patty cake
Blood gang, red bandanna face
Make them pussies pop they-self
You can call that “masturbate”
I don’t front no fabricate
I get high, I gravitate
Weezy F Baby bitch, the F is for Fascinate
Louisiana, I’m from that swamp
I’mma pull this bitch out and dump
Better run like Forrest Gump
Fuck you and where you from
3, 2, I am the one, job well done
I ball 24/7, 365, 12 months
Wassup redbone? Wassup caramel?
Come to Wayne’s World, it’s a fairy tale
Yeah I’m high bitch, bitch I para-sail
You might also like
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Lite it up, cause I'm a smoker
Shots leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga
Shots leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga
Shots leave your body looking like you're doin' yoga, yogaEmbed
