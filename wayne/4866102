9 ContributorsMona Lisa (Demo) Lyrics
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish these
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
When you really should sleep with a choppa 'cause you gon' wake up and see me with them choppas

Uh, I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell 'em, "Get him," they say, "Yes, daddy," and they don't care how we split it
And they so pretty, and their hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
And she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tell her your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with you
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'," she say, "What's missin'?" "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratched his head, she say, "Get back in bed," then she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, "Ooh, daddy, ooh", woo
She say, "Ooh, daddy, ooh," yeah, she took off his pants and his shoes
He opened his eyes and saw that barrel goin' "boom," nigga, yeah

I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches, that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind, and tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell him, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place," and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She don't want love, she just want her share, she feed him lies with his silverware

I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you," she say, "Yes, daddy", I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
So we're waitin' outside, we watched him pull up, and walk up to the door
And right before he knock, she open the door naked, they started French kissin', but he didn't see moi
She left it unlocked, they didn't make it to the room, so they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds, turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, shoot him dead in his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after, if Liz call you daddy, we call her a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, and if you alone, she bankrupts you niggas
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Then you wake up and see guns in your face, and Mona Lisa out of frame on these niggas
That pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
We take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have yo' attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, you more terrified than a Fatter Joe, nigga
Don't be a pussy for pussy, my nigga, don't be a asshole over pantyhose, nigga, quit playin'
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing, I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout no motherfuckin' double-standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah4Embed
