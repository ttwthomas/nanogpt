15 ContributorsForever Winning Lyrics
If not us then who
Leggo

Young Money we the hardest team
Forever winning bitch
We on our Charlie Sheen
Make that ass jump
Girl do your damn thing
We bout that life
And them niggas ain't about a damn thing

Okay, they say time is money and most say life is short
So I chase my dollar signs and let that bullshit walk
You in that bullshit
You might as well walk
I’m in the air first class
Pound key, can't talk sorry
Look in my eyes and you gonna see its a real nigga
No deck of cards nigga
I'll deal with you
I talk to the ghost of James Brown
It was a man's world then and its a man's world now
If you a fake nigga before then you a fake nigga now
Nothing change, same song
Same lyrics, same sound
Same shit different day
New problems every day
That revolver got that bang
That automaty just spray
Fuck games I don't play
Unless it's NBA 2k
Or that Madden
I ain't laughing
You next to pay
That's just Jae
Jae don’t think
Jae just go H.A.M
Before you could blink
You go get a drink
She wink next thing I know she's bent over my sink

Young Money we the hardest team
Forever winning bitch
We on our Charlie Sheen
Make that ass jump
Girl do your damn thing
We bout that life
And them niggas ain't about a damn thing

It's Lil Tunechi
I ain't on shit, I was born Wayne
Wish I was born rich
Millz what it do
Where them New York bitches
If these walls could talk
I hope they talk business
And I got my money right
And since my money right
I can get some kidnappers
To go kidnap your son and wife
I dont pack a gun or knife
I pack a checkbook
And I just point guard
Russel Westbrook
On the real nigga
The clips got curves
That's sex appeal nigga
I’m extra ill, you
Pay the medical bill nigga
We masked up like there
Was a chemical spill nigga
Fuck with me e-y-e
Be damn if you will nigga
When we rolling we pop you
Like an extra pill nigga
Shoot to kill nigga
The truth will kill niggas
One time for Harlem
Two for Millz nigga, Tunechi3Embed
