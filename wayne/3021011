(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
San-tana, AY
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
Tick, tock
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
Tick, tock
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)

Get on the grind like clockwork
Move that behind like clockwork
Keep it coming on time like clockwork
Get that clockwork (homie) make that clockwork (shorty)

You hear the sounds of the tick (tick)
You hear the sounds of the tock (tock)
You hear the sounds of the clock (tick)
(And get it right) (tock)
Move to the sound of the tick (tick)
Move to the sound of the tock (tock)
Move to the sound of the clock (tick)
(And get it right) (tock) yep yep

Now lemme see you get that block work rolling
Lemme see you get that clockwork going
Fiends copping by the clockwork flowing
All day and all night
Till them S.W.A.T. cops rolling
Or that clock, stop, going
Tick, tock, tick, tock, AY
Homie, get on the grind like clockwork
Two for five or a dime, that's clockwork
Shorty
You ain't gettin off the hook that easy
Lemme see that clockwork
She said look that's easy
Move it around, and around, and around, and around like a clock chick
To the sound, of the sound, of the sound of the clock's tick
Tick, tock, tick, tock, AY
Shorty, move that behind like clockwork
And spin around to the sound of how the clock work

You hear the sounds of the tick (tick)
You hear the sounds of the tock (tock)
You hear the sounds of the clock (tick)
(And get it right) (tock)
Move to the sound of the tick (tick)
Move to the sound of the tock (tock)
Move to the sound of the clock (tick)
(And get it right) (tock) yep yep
Get on the grind like clockwork
Move that behind like clockwork
Keep it coming on time like clockwork
Get that clockwork (homie) make that clockwork (shorty)

Mad trees and shrees and dungarees
The city under siege
Kitchen 100 degrees
I love that summer breeze I stand in it til' it freeze
I'm from another creed them S-s-southern G's
I sip Promethazine I lean I stand tall
I'm mean I'm mad raw I'm comin' like fastballs
Steee-rike, Yup, so get it right
One of my snippets'll end your whole life
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife
In a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat pork
So be smart and play your own part
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell
Hey, I'ma shoot it out if I'm facing the L
Yea, so tell your girl to come and make me rich
Weezy Baby nigga, 9 to 5, 10 to 6
All dayEmbed
