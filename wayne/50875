25 ContributorsBaseball Sex LyricsLil Wayne
Yeah (take me out, take me out)
Ok now it was me and Mrs. C
We was chillin by ourself
Both of us just popped a pill
And now am feelin' myself
I ain't worried bout you cause I'm feelin' myself
I ain't worried bout you cause I'm feelin' myself
And they feelin' my shoe and they feelin' my belt
And they feelin' my jean thats the one they never seen
And my watch look like a television screen
And my right wrist nice and my left wrist mean
And now my neck gettin' all jealous and things
So I had to cop a couple of more necklaces man
Like ain't that a bitch?
Ain't a bitch I ain't my words
Heavy so I hope them bitches stick like paint
And all I really care about is my bank ho
And all I really care about is my bank ho
And all I really care about is my bank ho
Ya digg? now, what you drank?
I tell her bartender just straight patron
Man I'm takin one of these girls home
And we can do what we do we grown
We can do what we do we grown
I met her on first base standin' all alone
We went to second base and now she in my zone
Then we told Mr. Third Base we gon'
I told you im taking one of these girls home (safe)
You might also likeMack Maine
I take a chick out the park like Barry
She held my balls so long the ref call her carry
She come to the crib and she think we married
She try to sneak in my bed like the tooth fairy (ha)
I call her genius oral she give me head sex
And all my bitches like packages they get FedEx
You can call 'em priority of 'da next day
They call the next day like "Maine I'm still rollin'"
I'm like well im heading to the game you still rollin'?
Like let me know your destiny child like Kelly Rowland
You think she lift weights with her brain the way she headstrong
You see my house is third base I call my bed home
You call her Miss Decapitated yeah her head gon'
She think she living right but I tell her she dead wrong
And I don't care if she all fat or she all slender
And I ain't T-Pain but this what I told the bartender
CHORUS
I tell her bartender just straight patron
Man I'm takin one of these girls home
And we can do what we do we grown
We can do what we do we grown
I met her on first base standin' all alone
We went to second base and now she in my zone
Then we told Mr. Third Base we gon'
I told you im taking one of these girls home (safe)
Lil Wayne
Now run around a base
You know I come from outter space
And I'm runnin out of space
Cause I got to much paper
I ain't got enough space
You call that girl 7
Cause she finna get 8
If you call her at 7
Then probably gettin' ate
Tomorrow call her at 7
And she still gettin' ate
Ya now she do me
And girl what the bitch say?
"daddy please could you come
And put some tears in my face" (haha)
She wanna Lil Wayne on her face
I said well bitch go get lil' wayne on youre face (haha)
Then I came in her face
You know a nigga had to make it rain in her face
Bitch I know you love me
If not you just stupid
Nigga stop talkin'
And why dont you just do it?
But fuck them niggas girl me and you should do it
And you know im gon' of that fluid you ain't see me tell
The bartender just straight patron
Man I'm takin one of these girls home
And we can do what we do we grown
We can do what we do we grown
I met her on first base standin' all alone
We went to second base and now she in my zone
Then we told Mr. Third Base we gon'
I told you im taking one of these girls home (safe)
I swear I told the bartender just straight patron
Man I'm takin one of these girls home
First base
Second base
Third base
We Home
We can do what we do we grown3Embed
