Toot it up, drop

Walk in with like 20 bands, throw it on the thickest thighs
Put her in the sunken place, she said she was dick-notized
Uh, get the prize
Uh, yeah, get the prize
Uh, nuh, make this money, (Yee) incentivize
Drop, in her walls, yeah, ooh, in her walls
For a hour plus, I just missed like twenty calls
Pussy drippin', runnin' like Niagara Falls (Yeah)
Keep her head in my Balenciaga drawers
Getting money, with the dogs
Ayy, in my hot tub, is twenty broads
After, you back it up, then stop
Wa-wa-wa-wa, drop it like it's hot
Yee!

I bought a watch, not for the clock
I bought it to flex on them thots
And I'm still fucking on Jenny from the block
I still pull down and shoot up the opps (Brr)
I just bought the drop head
They want to see me like 'Pac, dead
Hit 'em with the bottle, serve the hot lead
I ain't gonna eat your twat, yeah (Gang, gang)
Hoe, you can close your legs
Dirty ass bitch, need to make up your bed
Stank ass hoe, you need to fix yo edges (Uh)
Look at them stank ass legs, uh, uh
I'm on tour
Lambo, 'rari, I'm not sure
If the feds knock on the door, tell them bitches I'm not here

H-h-huh?
Heaters flowin', make 'em drop
I got stripes like German scar
Money, we keep that alive
And we don't gotta rob the spot
Eye-eye-eye-eye drop, teardrops
Runnin' when I hear cops
We don't do no cleaning, but them sticks up over here, mops (That's on my mama)
Drop, get it, sauce with it
And we don't love 'em, we just strictly toss bitches
Loft bitches, boss bitches
The letter "T", the way I double cross bitches
