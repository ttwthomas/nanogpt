10 ContributorsSo Gone LyricsShut Up!

Who am I, I'm doing mine
Gave me the chance; I won't letcha go
I wanna be more than just sexual
But every time I'm so gone
Gone -on -on , soo gone
Cause you gone, it's forever now

Young Mula Baby
I'm a blood, I'm a pro, I'm a G
In a different world, outerspace with a freak
But that don't mean Neptune on the beat
Cause its Nu Jerzey Devil from Black Wall Street
Weezy F baby from Young Money baby
Like the Easter bunny, baby wanted my candy
So I gave her my lollipop then she made her body pop
Then that made me kinda hot
I'm lying that made me sauna hot
But please stop sweatin on me, women scream "get in me"
And what do I do I get in 'em , I put on my boots and I step in 'em
Right left in em Mr. Excedrin
Head all the time, it may sound crazy but I got head on my mind
Lay it on the line or just lay on young Carter!
And yeah I hear you screaming but my name ain't harder!
Girl I'm nasty I do my thing and have you calling for me like Lassie
You might also like

I'mma flirt man I really don't care
I tell the women whatever they wann hear
Mommy I'm balling I'm so sincere
Is that your home girl sitting right there
She can be my monday
You can be my tuesday
After shorty done I can squeeze ya'll in today
Three is not a crowd I don't care what you say
My women come in twos like shoes with a cute face!
My girl gotta girlfriend, her girl gotta girlfriend
Bring her to the crib I'm a show you how I work it
Little man in the boat here come the serpeants
Slide your body down the pole and let me see you twerk it
I'm with my thursday junk she a real freak
A hundred grand fitting right up in her butt cheek
Mrs friday go easy cause she just learnin
But saturday be having mr devil's toes curlin
