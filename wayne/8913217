1 ContributorSwagger Like Us Lyrics
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

Mr. West is in the buildin'
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Ayo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermès, Pastelle, I pass the dressin'
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
"Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?"
'Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan
You might also like
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Church, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire
I got stripes, Adidas
Mami scream "¡Papí, no más!"
Run up in your shit, just me, no más
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us, 'cause we the only thing to talk about
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like usEmbed
