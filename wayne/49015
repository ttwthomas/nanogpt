28 ContributorsPray to the Lord Lyrics
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake

Yeah, I wrote my will just the other week
And what's funny, it was only one sheet
And I know there's only one me
But I hope I am everything my son be
I'm tryin' live right, stay on the drum beat
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat
I wonder will I lose control of the Maserati
And hit some tree, just being young me?
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?
I can't go to hell, 'cause I'd take over
I feel it approaching, but I ain't scared
I made that bed and I should rest in peace
You might also like
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake

Yeah, and every time I see the sunshine
I drop down and give thanks at least one time
Feeling like I'm living on the front line
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunchtime?
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night
Pistol on my lap at every single red light
Yeah, I made my bed right, so when I do I should sleep tight
In peace I rest
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake

Bury me a gangsta cause that's what I live
Don't cry for me, I gave the best I could give
I can only do me, so that's what I did
And I cherish every breath of my kid
And I don't want to go before she grow, that ain't cool
But in this game of life, I don't make the rules
Shit, so that's why I get twisted
So I can't feel it when it hits me
And my moms don't need that on her
But I see death around the corner
And if he so happens to make his way around the block
You gotta answer the door when he knock, believe that
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
And if I should die, before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take
For goodness' sake3Embed
