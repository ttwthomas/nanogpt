2 ContributorsSalute LyricsFirst off I'm a muthafuckin'
G-en-er-al word to the cake shells
In this chopper will pop em
Make it sound like a helli-choppers land on top of this bitch
You want this whopper come and get your beef nigga
I'm not a boxer I'm be brief nigga
Were on top I will put you underneath niggas
We will take your whole tribe and I'm the chief nigga
Your highest title numero uno
I'm not that little pregnant white girl but juno
You no anything within a nigga reach
My dogs will bite you and guess who the nigga leash
I was once told by my nigga Meach
You feed a sucka' he just grow to be a bigger leach
So everytime you hear mine get your hand to your hairline

Yeah I'm in this bitch
Sending champagne to my enemy's
Salute or shoot you choose mu'fucka'
Bow down till your head touch your shoes mu'fucka'
Salute me, salute me, salute me, salute me
Salute or shoot you choose mu'fucka'
Bow down till your head touch your shoes mu'fucka'
Salute me

And I stay away from magnets cause that metals what I'm packin'
Bet your brains on your shirt will look like jello on a napkin
And I promise my fellows will put your fellow on a canvas
Call me Wezezy F baby Young Money army, betta' yet Navy
Fab' I got 'em
And watch me get 'em
And I do 'em
How I did 'em
And tool inside my denim
I shoot everything but woman and kids
Bitch niggas stop bitchin' it's just how it is
Now watch me let that sexy Nina kiss you by my ribs
You won't be satisfied till I send a missile by your crib
Shoot you in the stomach now your pissin' out your ears
Hollygrove all day bodies in the hallway
And if you come searchin' then your finding out the hard way (ugh)
No matter where your from you better recognize a real
Nigga when you see one
Salute me

At second thought I got the heart of a solider
Told ya I ain't gon' play y'all
My mind has gon' awall
Find it I will pay y'all
My money is yay tall okay y'all
A smidget stack is midget mack
That mean it's gon' stay small
Told dem I don't see nobody
I'm a rappin' Ray Charles (I don't see nobody)
I think I need a seein' I dog
Come to being fly dog
You ain't seeing I dog (OK OK OK OK)
We sit in here like pollen now
Fuck you niggas hollerin' now
They said I been M-I-A
Yea bitch I'm on columns now
Leaders gon' be followin' crowds
General like Colin Powell
Water means Cary gay
Beef is just a style of cow
I who make the call
So make me get the dialin' out
Nick got the cannon yea dat nigga be widlin' out
They ain't ballin' these niggas is filin' out
They ain't throwin' jives they just throwin' the towels out yeaEmbed
