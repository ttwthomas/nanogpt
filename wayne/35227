Yo, uh, you didn't see this one comin', did ya?
All the way from the N.O to S.T.L
Nelly-Nel and Lil' Wayne

Now on the scale of one to ten, I been rated, a 12 (right!)
You know this and these cats hate it
I got nothin' outdated, if it is it's upgraded
S-Class with everything voice-activated
Chrome rim three-bladed, factory custom made it
Paid with big faces, if it's broke then replace it
Now it's like that, purple haze and cognac
On the beach in L.A. with dime bitches ridin' my back

I represent them street niggas
When they get hot, carry the heat niggas
Them sweet niggas off they feet niggas
You livin' on the edge Fleet nigga
That's why my clique we do or die and roll deep nigga
Ain't nothing sweet nigga, recognize the bloody clothes
Ready to represent the 'Grove with two Calico's
I carry 4's in my side pocket
While yours cockin' nigga mine poppin'
Walk through your house with my iron knockin'
See Nelly LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also like
I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night
This is for my bitches with the style and grace
Who ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face
I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night
This is for my bitches with the style and grace
Who ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face

I ain't bullshittin', I trick 'em and run up in their kitty
If she ain't a nine or better, my niggas then I'm splittin'
Get a code-red, hop in the Jag and fled
Bumpin' N.O.R.E number six, "Bitch give me some head"
And for you niggas out there who be jacking the wrist
Got a new group for ya, Nina Ross and the Clips
And from the hip I shoot, if you wanna get loot
'Bout ta tell ya the truth
I'm more focused I'm born in the Lou'

I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night
This is for my bitches with the style and grace
Who ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face
I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night
This is for my bitches with the style and grace
Who ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face
I ain't no busta nigga
Came up out that Hollygrove dungeon, nigga
Flame up and toast let it get sparkin' up in here
You don't make it out alive very often up in here
I'ma speak on behalf of the C.M.B. partna
I'm a sweep off ya Ave if its any beef partna
I skeet off a bag of the dilly-D partna
Slip me on a mask hit the Benz wit three choppers
Weezy-Wee partna

Four karats in my earring, five around my knuckle
Six wrap the wrist, check the belt buckle
Leave them wit it look like Nelly I didn't know
If you was the Jackie Frost why didn't you say so
Somebody gotta shine my nigga why not me
Even my dentist told me floss 7 days a week
Freeza burnt out the piece Gucci and hat sweet
Butter soft leather seats for trash talkin' freaks

I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night
This is for my bitches with the style and grace
Who ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face
I'm doing this one for my niggas who be keepin' it tight
Only lovin' dime bitches that fuck on the first night
This is for my bitches with the style and grace
Who ain't hear nothin' talkin' but the bitch in their face
I'm doing this one for my niggas
Uh, uh, ha bet ya no were ready for that one hu, ha, ha
We know ya didn't see that one comin'
Uh, uh E.I
Uh, uh wodieEmbed
