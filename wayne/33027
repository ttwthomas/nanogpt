It's a major move right here, baby
You gotta get with it or get lost, you understand
Yeah, it's Young Lloyd reporting live from Atlanta, Georgia
Weezy F. Baby, Decatur where it's greater
And uh, I want all my sexy ladies to report to the dance floor immediately
We gon' Golden Glide this one y'all, speak Weezy

Right off the bat ma, the boy got dollars
So women come frequent like flight mileage
It ain't no secret, I— I might holla
But I ain't gonna sweat ya, baby, I'ma let you
Catch up with your game, run faster
Don't let him lose you 'cause I ain't gon' bless ya
Unless you feeling a lil' desperate
Send a nigga a text message, girl

Stop, wait a minute
The way you move that girl
You done got my heart all in it
And I just wanna be with you tonight
Girl, please
I'm a player, yeah, it's true
But I change the game for you
I wanna see what it do
You might also like
Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Ooh, you're just my type
Everything's so right
And I just wanna chill
So let's dip up out of here
Let's dip up out of here

Ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha
She's fine too
But I want you
Ha, ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha
She's fine too
But I want you

I’ll admit it
This just ain't no game
These just ain't words that I'm spitting
If you could see the thoughts that's in my head
I'm tripping (Thoughts that's in my head)
I'm a player, yeah, it's true
But I'll change the game for you
See what I do, ooh
Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Ooh, you're just my type
Everything's so right (So right)
And I just wanna chill
So let's dip up out of here
Let's dip up out of here

Ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha
She's fine too
But I want you
Ha, ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha
She's fine too
But I want you

Yeah, Weezy F. Baby, the key to the ladies
Keys to the 'cedes, but please say the "Baby"
Weed and Patrón, even in the A.M
We should be alone, we can get a day in
You like what I'm saying, then come around the way and—
We can go inside and stay in
Tell the homeboy you staying, you've been taken
Gone, turn me on, and I'ma turn him (Yeah)
You know I love you like cooked food
You know you fucking with a good dude
You know you give good brain like you graduated from a good school
You know I'm a good move, you should do—
Me, so hey, shawty, what it is?
Tha Carter who it is, and shawty do it big
A party at my crib—that's a party in the hills
You call it what you want, but she gon' call it what she feel
Ow!
Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Ooh, you're just my type
Everything's so right (So right)
And I just wanna chill
So let's dip up out of here
Let's dip up out of here

Ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha
She's fine too
But I want you
Ha, ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha
She's fine too
But I want you

I ain't nothing but a nonviolent nigga, you know what I mean?
Street love, big love, c'mon
Me and lil' Lloyd, baby
Long hair, don't care
Yo, what up, Ryan? I see you baby, yeah
It's major moves right here, baby
I ain't talking fast—it's just, you listening slow, you know what I mean?
You ain't tryna hear me, then don't heard me, I'm up outta here
I ain't being mean, but you so mean in them jeans, you know what I mean? So what you want me to do? You26Embed
