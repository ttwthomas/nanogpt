Okay, Comme Des Garçons and some new Saint Laurent
I mix Gianni Versace with Coco Chanel
I throw on some Fendi, a mink when it's windy
Too cold for the Devil, I'm snowin' in Hell
Skatin' on marble, I flow in thin air
I'm dancin' on water, tip-toein' on nails
Can't walk in my shoes, can't roll in my wheels
Can't order my food, you throw up that meal
Can't do what I do, you can't do me
Yeah, I would not try to do you, I'm too me
Look at my sons' faces, I see the new me
I look into they face and I see the beauty
I take a vacation and go see some beautiful shit
Come back with a whole different view of this shit
My third eye just opened 'cause two wasn't shit
It's either that or too many hallucinogens
Got a cute-ass lil' bitch with a coke habit
That lil' bitch at my crib 'til the snow cappin'
When we fuck, man, that shit make her go faster
She so numb, man, that bitch ain't got no passion
Ain't no love in that bitch, ain't no romancin'
Ain't no love in that bitch, ain't got no magic
Ain't no judgin' that bitch 'cause we both addicts
She in love with this dick, it got gold status
Huh, Comme Des Garçons
I got that bread like a biscuit, a bun or croissant
Got the feds on my dizzick, they bustin' my balls
And she play with my dick, make me bust in my drawers
And I take off my Ethika, I'm gettin' naked
And she gettin' wet and now I'm gettin' erections
Oh, she say it spiritual when I have sex with her
I'm blessin' her, I think I pop too much ecs' with her
I fuck with my ex with her, you keep the rest of her
Don't care who left with her, I don't wan' F with her
Hop off that pedestal if you wan' leave
Then it was my pleasure, them thots is more pleasurable
I'm on my medical, smokin' my vegetable
Bro cut my revenue down to the decimal
Rollie, I stare at you, then I start tellin' you
How much I care for you, I diamond bezel you
Comme Des Garçons with that Yves Saint Laurent
I mix new CDG with some new YSL
I pop my trunk, how this new chopper feel?
All you get is "buck-buck" like a two-dollar bill
I'm so fucked up, they say, "You gotta chill"
So-so fucked up, Tunechi, you're outta here
Raw in the cut, smokin' dope, poppin' pills
Since I'm goin' so nuts, I drip pure almond milk
Ugh, Comme Des Garçons, fuck what they all say
Nigga, fuck what they done, I give a fuck what they on
I run in your place, like, "Honey, I'm home," like, "Honey, I'm wrong"
'Cause I tell you, "I love you," and honey, I don't
Got too many girlfriends, got too many girlfriends, one in my trunk
Ooh, money, I flaunt, ooh, money, I flaunt
I spend money on war, which one of y'all want war?
None of y'all want war, that's what the fuck l thought
Fuck you thought, I drop a contract on your heart
Give a fuck what that cost, suffer that loss
Stuffed in that box and dumped in that park
Fuck you thought, I drop a contract on your heart
Give a fuck what that cost, gotta suffer that loss
Stuffed in that box and dumped in that park
Okay, Comme Des Garçons and some new Saint Laurent
I mix Gianni Versace with Coco Chanel
Can't walk in my shoes, you can't roll in my wheels
You can't order my food, you gon throw up that meal
Comme Des Garçons
