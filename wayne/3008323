38 ContributorsFaith Lyrics
See that nigga at home? It's all good
Mike WiLL Made-It
EarDrummers

That last drought was a setback
That red light is a death trap
That jail time was a wrist slap
That jail time was a quick nap
That redbone is my new twap
I got a new coupe, you got a new app
I'm from Louisiana, the boot nigga
It's like boot camp, baby

Call the valet, pull up in front
Drop the top and let them bitches see the guts
I drop the top and let you bitches see the guts
We hittin' licks, it taste like victory to us
And I always have faith (faith) in my plug (plug)
Clean slates (slates) dirty lungs
Give me my collection plate (plate) like Reverend Run (Run)
Movin' snowflakes (flakes) so wear some Uggs
Nigga get the duck tape, (yeah) ski mask and gloves (yeah)
Don't leave a trace, (don't leave a trace) don't leave a crumb
'Cause it's always what you take, not who you took it from (Amen)
We just see them as bait, we just see them as young
Men that always have faith (faith) in my connect
Shoot you in your Durex, leave you lookin' like a Kotex
And I'm always half baked (yep) sippin' slow death
Shinin', puttin' these carrots in your face like a snowman
And I always have faith
You might also like
I need to know
I need to, I need to know
Tell me somethin' (yeah) tell me somethin' (yeah)
Is you stuntin' or you fuckin' or fuckin' stuntin'?
Is you ballin' or is you broke?
We fuckin' stuntin' (we fuckin' stuntin')
And if we partyin' with these hoes
We fuckin' somethin' (we fuckin' somethin')
I'm from New Orleans on these hoes
I'm from the dungeon (I'm from the dungeon)
I can't be partyin' with these hoes
I'm outchea hustlin' (I'm outchea hustlin')

I'm outchea hustlin' for a meal (meal)
She bustin' for a deal (she bustin)
Beyoncé wasn't lyin'
We all got bills, bills, bills
I try to tell my bitch that (bae)
She say, "Yeah, right with your rich ass" (okay)
I can't fight with her thick ass (no way)
We cat fight then we kiss ass (okay)

That last drought was a setback (Amen)
That red light is a death trap (Amen)
That jail time was a wrist slap (Amen)
That jail time was a quick nap (shh)
That red-bone is my new twap
I got a new coupe, you got a new app (yeah)
Louisiana, the boot is like boot camp
And you know where I'ma stick this boot at, bitch ass nigga
(Yeah, yeah)
Told my bro, "I need a whole thang, I need a whole thang"
Why he brought my ass some dog food? I need some cocaine (alright)
Had to tell my baby mama, "Front your daddy's whole thang" (alright)
Ain't no playin' with my money, we ain't playin' no games (tell 'em)
HoodyBaby, fat Jesus (tell 'em) I got all these gold chains
On the highway racin' killers, we just call it road rage (alright)
Call me Neighborhood Hoody, it's a neighborhood thang
Man, my cellphone ringin', got a call from Mack Maine (Mack)
I got faith (I got faith) in my trap house (in my trap house)
State to state (state to state) I got it mapped out (I got it mapped out)
I got a safe (I got a safe) and a stash house (oh Lord)
HoodyBaby whip the white 'til I black out!

Tell me somethin' (yeah) tell me somethin' (yeah)
Is you stuntin' or you fuckin' or fuckin' stuntin'?

We fuckin' stuntin' (fuckin' stuntin')
We can't be partyin' with these hoes
We're fuckin' nothing (we can't be partyin')
I'm from New Orleans on these hoes
I'm from the dungeon (Louisiana)
I can't be partyin' (I can't be partyin')
I'm outchea hustlin' (I'm outchea hustlin')
Always have faith (have faith) in my plug (in my plug)
I had to scrape and get it out the mud
I ain't always have cake (no) so I don't judge
And my homies have faith in me so in Tunechi we trust
Tell 'em, hoes!

I need to know, yeah (I need to know)
