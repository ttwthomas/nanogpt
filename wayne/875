20 ContributorsHaterz Lyrics
Yeah yeah (yessir)
Bad ass blue division, baby (su-woo)
So crazy around here right now nigga (Eastside)
It's like Kobe and Shaq (ya dig?) G and Weezy bitch
Who banging the squad Cash Money the team
Young Money All-Stars muthafuckas
(Young Mula baby!) Pay attention nigga, yeah

I'm in the club going dumb something clean out front like uhhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Looking so damn fly sending corks through the sky like ahhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Spend a hundred on my timepiece so if you ain't a dimepiece
Whoa, you know them haterz gon like that
Shit but that just how it goes when a nigga getting dough like ohhh
You know them haterz gon like that

I hear you talking hater but you ain't saying nothing
I hear you talking hater but you ain't saying nothing
I hear you talking hater but you ain't saying nothing
Man I let them keep talking as long as muthafucka walking

I'm a grown ass man, you wanna to see I.D
Filthy rich on the floor fuck V.I.P
Got my hand on my drink other hand on my waist
Two-stepping to the beat I chuck my set in niggas face like ohh
This beat got me bouncing like a check
In my Crown Holder jeans cost a stack on my specs
I'm looking like money if I see it than I'm stacking it
Your wife in my scope and my shot is so accurate
You niggas like activists appealing to the psyche
Man Malone will get it jerkin I 'Just Do It' like Nike
Seein really with the fighting and I'm really with the business
I'm married to the game man God as my Witness
You might also like
I'm in the club going dumb something clean out front like uhhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Looking so damn fly sending corks through the sky like ahhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Spend a hundred on my timepiece so if you ain't a dimepiece
Whoa, you know them haterz gon like that
Shit but that just how it goes when a nigga getting dough like ohhh
You know them haterz gon like that

Weezy F naturally born baby
Prp's, SB's, matching shirt, maybe
White-T, neck V, glasses are Versace
Married to the Mob but I'm a bachelor baby
Love is in the air I put on a gas mask
I rather be head first than an ass last
I'm a gorilla call me Sasquatch
And I keep my army with me like M.A.S.H
Light up the purp pass it like Steve Nash
Bitch I'm so hot I'll give your ass a heat rash
Young Money boy I'm on 03' cash
Such a CEO like my homie D-Dash
Yeah... we mash like Pac and the Outlaws
And we stand-up and try not to down-fall
I'm trying to reach my goal like a round-ball
Freddy Adu anything for the crown ya'll
Or David Beckham only pay'em or respect'em
Pop one, pop two, bitch I'm on a triple decker
Icicle on my necklace on my cashmere sweater
Keep a shotgun I'm a Hunter like Heather
Yessir shut up and listen to the professor
Or it could get ugly like Esther
Whether in the South or that West Coast weather
I'm popping, Malone and Stockton
I'm in the club going dumb something clean out front like uhhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Looking so damn fly sending corks through the sky like ahhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Spend a hundred on my timepiece so if you ain't a dimepiece
Whoa, you know them haterz gon like that
Shit but that just how it goes when a nigga getting dough like ohhh
You know them haterz gon like that

If you got a fly ride put your keys in the sky scream ahhh
You know them haterz gonna like that
If you feeling like a star spend a thousand at the bar scream oooh
You know them haterz gonna like that
If it's hundreds in your pursue ass hiking up your shirt scream ahhh
You know them haterz gonna like that
If your girl is a duck and your hair is whipped up
Scream oooh, you know them haterz gonna like that

Dropped a hundred on the watch couple hundred on the chain
Whip our front cost half of whole thang
Drop head rows with the automatic doors
Fifty on my pinky twenty five on my hoes
Stunner man been balling since the 80's
Bought fifty whips bought one for my lady
Bet your bottom dollar jewels ain't flaws
Cash Money ball to you fall
I'm in the club going dumb something clean out front like uhhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Looking so damn fly sending corks through the sky like ahhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Spend a hundred on my timepiece so if you ain't a dimepiece
Whoa, you know them haterz gon like that
Shit but that just how it goes when a nigga getting dough like ohhh
You know them haterz gon like that
