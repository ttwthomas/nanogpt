26 ContributorsI Know the Future Lyrics
Straight from the bottom of the cut
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me
One man with no weapon at war, but I'm an army
My flow is captain: attention, lieutenant
Your penny pension and they demolished that invention
You better get your dollars up, and guess what, I was up
I get my cheese like Mickey Mouse, or else you better Donald Duck
Like a shootin' range target, I get all kinda bucks
Be my shootin' range target, nigga I got good luck
Nigga bye bye good luck, got your momma shook up
Lil bad ass nigga, who thought Popeye wasn't tough
I'm on that la la, twist it up, I'm on that syrup, slow it down
And I like four freaks too, and I ain't Yung Joc but its goin' down
I buy a marijuana field, then I just mow it down
Big bad wolf, yes, I just blow it down
No homo and to Hollygrove, I will hold it down
Like a circle of knives, I got the sharpest flow around

Future (I know)
Future (I know)
Future (I know)
Future (I know)
Future
I know they can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self

Bitch I'm Mack Maine
I got the heart of a king, blood of a slave
Feel like I been there before, my second time to the grave
But it's one life to live, that's why I'm gettin' paid
Off a flow that's priceless, I just got it appraised
Spit like I need a raise, blaze as I gaze
At the stars and ask the Lord, why the culprit's at the pulpit
It make me sick to my stomach, that's why I rap
Like a pregnant woman, I don't spit I vomit
So pay homage, me and Wayne two G's
Like twenty hundreds and we keep the semis blunted
And we live like brothers from another
So fuck with him and Mack gonna react like you did me somethin'
That's a hint to you Davids, throwin' shots at Goliath
This the New Testament, where the victor is the giant
So you should get your weight and lose the hate
Remember males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female's trait
