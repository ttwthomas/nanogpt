1 ContributorPlay That Shit Lyrics
They call me the youngest head buster walkin'
Thugged out in all black, Calico sparkin'
A guerrilla till I die, bless me when I'm dead
But for the bread, I'll bring ya anybody head
That's how I play it, I don't hold back
I tote gats, be on the spot where ya sold crack
Nigga feel played, then ya fuckin' get blown back
I burn 'em twice with a black rusty old MAC
Now. blakka, nigga, get off me

Get some off that cocky weed and roll that bitch up
Won't play with me like I'ma choke that bitch up
Keep it on the turf, I might be killin' to get mine
New prints on the back, I make a million in big time
I'll always be a thug until I'm crippled and crazy
I'ma always stay close with Suga Slim, Wayne, and Baby
Runnin' with a team off cut-throats and backshots
All day bullshittin' negligence and homicides
Cash Money niggas, they don't play that shit
Thugged Out niggas, we don't play that shit
Thugged Out, Cash Money ha
B.G Juvenile ain't funny ha
We try to get that paper like Bugs Bunny, ha
Yo we in the projects with my little honey, ha
Yo, what up Kiko? It gets real. check it
We got's this chicks to slauve that right out of Kansas
Heyyo, these countless bitches
We used to fuck 'em on campus
You my roley ha ha
I'm your roley ha ha
Fuck with us, we leave you nigga fuckin' holy ha
Semi-Latin cruise down to Baton Rouge
Then I got a Hummer that's sittin' on 32's
But for the hood we got the East coast locked
Magnolia and Iraq now that's my spots
Come anywhere near there and still be shot
Prat niggas, shot niggas, shot niggas, shot niggas
Shot, shot
Cash Money niggas, they don't play that shit
Thugged Out niggas, we don't play that shit
From N Y to N O, Thugged Out and Cash Money
I'm a thug B, how you gonna stop hungry
We eatin' pop bubbley in beef we pop dummies
Run up in hood honey's, it's all good sonney
Throw your sets up nigga, throw your side up nigga
Ride or die young nigga, get high young nigga
Stay fly young nigga
Do what you gotta survive young nigga
Live we fly down in New Orleans
Get it purpulatin'
You smell me keep that fire green circulatin'
Thugged Out with Cash Money
Thugs we stash your arms
Weeds get blazed from your face till feet
With us all we stay deep got beef we're surroundin'
My niggas cock back macs from here to some 'the houses
Get rocked or get it on if you bout it
'Cause boy, you're in the zone
You take routes quick like Roy Jones
Cash Money niggas, they don't play that shit
Thugged Out niggas, we don't play that shit
Play that shit, play that shit, play that shitYou might also likeEmbed
