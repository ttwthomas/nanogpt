50 ContributorsBallin’ Lyrics
You think you ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You think you ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball

Hopped up out the bed, I think my roof gone
Think I forgot to put my roof on
Said “fuck it, buy another car”
Hopped out the Lamb’
Said “fuck it", bought another car
I bought the Phantom just to say it’s black
I bought the Phantom just to take a nap
I’m getting head in the backseat
I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete
I’m ballin’ hard, I need a jersey on
So much bread on me, I can buy a Jersey home
I’m on them Diddy’s, spendin’ Dirty Money
I’m on that Jizzle, spendin’ birdy money

You think you ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You think you ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball
See Jeezy LiveGet tickets as low as $52You might also like
Still ballin’ like a muthafucker, tell ‘em that
Three platinum chains to match my platinum plaques
Ain’t got nuttin’ gold but some gold chains
Say “Jizzle, what’s the dough?”
Move the whole thang
My celly bumpin’ like a chat line
He bought a 500, needy, need a halftime
If yo job ain’t ballin’ hard, then you need to quit
You need a 18 hard, then you need to split
Summer’s mine, winter too
I’m poppin’ bottles in the club, that’s what winners do
They claiming bitches, them my old hoes
They claim they ballin’ in my old flows

You think you ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You think you ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball

These hoes call me Tunechi baby
Niggas think they seeing me, they hallucinating
Bitch, I’m balling, ballin’ like a motherfucker
12 gauge, bitch, I got a dozen of them
Niggas broke, acting like they got it though
I’m with a Spanish bitch, if she ain't fucking, adios!
So many cars I’m like eenie meenie minie moe
So many colors in the diamonds, Kaleidoscope
Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat
Run in ya house and get to poppin’ at your shower cap
My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac
And if them bitches don’t sell, we'll buy em back
Where the strippers, tell em Tune on his way
Tell them niggas I’m strapped like lingerie
You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball11Embed
