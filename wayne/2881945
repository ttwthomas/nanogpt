2 ContributorsMaking Love (Remix) Lyrics
She's a go-getter
Then she looking right in those stilettos
Backside softer than a rose petal
Down for whatever
Certified freak, can't nobody do it better
She's a true keeper
So I'mma scoop her up in that too, Sia
And make that body bump, like some blue sneakers
Sexy mamacita, got me mesmerized by her features

I'mma get you to my bed
Then I'mma get you out them clothes
Oh baby, we gon' freak all night
Just promise that you won't let go
Cause I'mma get you to my bed
Then I'mma get you out them clothes
Oh baby, we gon freak all night
Just promise that you won't let go

When we making love
When we making love
When we making love
When we making love
You might also like
I'm in the truck all black, rolling through the city
Seen her ass so fat, had to get her with me
I said do you need a ride? Do you have somewhere to be?
Told her, go on and hop inside
Come and ride with a G
Got a bangin' little body, and she dress to kill
Got that KOD swag, and that sex appeal
I know with me is where you wanna be
So I won't hesitate to get you home with me

I'mma get you to my bed (my bed)
Then I'mma get you out them clothes
Oh baby, we gon' freak all night (freak all night)
Just promise that you won't let go
Cause I'mma get you to my bed
Then I'mma get you out them clothes
Oh baby, we gon freak all night (freak all night)
Just promise that you won't let go

When we making love
When we making love
When we making love
When we making love
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like the heaven
We gon' make babies, let's be creative
She said need them tricks a long but I'm a skater
I love, I like the  told that no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I get her  and nervous, she's smiling and bluffing
And found a  in my phone that we'll probably fuckin', yeah
Lay your head back and said you're my freak
Then bringin' limit, won't spend it on a 
Cause when we're doin' it I'mma stroke you to the music
Get you  til your head guarantee you blow 
I swear you gon' love it, so let me get that working
Body language, we so foreign, got you open for discussion
Yeah, and since we on , may the love's gonna only leave to something

I'mma get you to my bed
Then I'mma get you out them clothes
Oh baby, we gon' freak all night
Just promise that you won't let go
Cause I'mma get you to my bed
Then I'mma get you out them clothes
Oh baby, we gon freak all night (freak all night)
Just promise that you won't let go
When we making love
When we making love
When we making love
When we making loveEmbed
