1 ContributorMoney, Drugs, Bitches, Liquor LyricsThese niggas are not like me
I been playin bapes since niggas thought they was bootleg nikes
This hoe put my name in a lot of bullshit, tryin to spite me
Guess she upset, cause she know I gotta wifey
Million dollar niggas still pushin Dodge Magnums
It holds 10 bodies, dependin on how ya stack em
Young boy never been attracted to madness
I'm inside watchin re-runs on "What's Happenin"
Lu been stackin, boy been concert since Wayne had my silver g wagon
Hot Spitta got a flow so proper
All these girls watchin me like soap operas
Money, drugs, bitches, liquor
Money, drugs, bitches, liquor
Money, drugs, bitches, liquor
Let's have ourselves a party!
Ye
And ya know I'm not playin man
You want a concert, well ya gotta pay the man
Look at my shirts and socks, call it the gator man
My cross over good, that's how I shake dem haters man
Ye
I got girls all over
Tell me what cha like and I'll call em over
I'm a high roller
And I ain't got no dogs in my yard, but I own a couple rovers
And you know how I get down there
Call before ya come, don't pop around here
Because it ain't be tellin who be found here
Either cookin cocoa cheese griss around here
Money, drugs, bitches, liquor
Money, drugs, bitches, liquor
Money, drugs, bitches, liquor
Let's have ourselves a party!
Ballin with shawty, she all over me
Um me how could a bitch say no to me
And I don't f*ck with them niggas
I want money, drugs, bitches, liquor
You know when I first got my deal, I got two porsches
And a hundred pairs of all white Air Forces
Never seen me with a bitch that ain't gorgeous
The boy flow hotter than papa pan's porridge
Pull out the garage in a Lotus
No it ain't the newest model out but it's hard to notice
I got more ice than a super-sized drink
And I know I'm the shit, I don't care what you think
You niggas ain't livin by the gun
I have you in a hospital bed being visited by nuns
Y'all pussy and I smell it
Make me stretch cheese on your head like a interval helmet
Money, drugs, bitches, liquor
Money, drugs, bitches, liquor
Money, drugs, bitches, liquor
Let's have ourselves a party!You might also likeEmbed
