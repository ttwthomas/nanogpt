Tunechi and 2 Chainz
Tunechi and 2 Chainz
ColleGrove on!

Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right

Mike told me this gon' be your favorite song
Ooh, wear that red one, that my favorite thong
Put 'em on, I said baby put 'em on
I said what you gonna do when you go home?
Kiss your man after you sucked on my woo!
She called my phone, I told her I was at the stu'
Last name Chainz, first name 2
Pull up on me, shawty you know what to do

Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
You might also like
I bought some gold chains with my drug money
Then wore it on the stage just to stunt on 'em
That's how we do it on the south side
Might buy an AK usin' all 5s
Big booty bitches in my archives
Potato on the barrel for you small fries
G4, G5 jet
Export, import checks on deck
Once the DJ drop this shit
Make 'em shake it like Tourette's
Smoking on the top floor, I'm as high as I can get
Lean in the baby bottle, I try not to babysit
So I had to take a sip, if I like it then I buy
Got so many damn rides I put my garage on a diet

Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right

ColleGrove, we out here
All these bitches want this dope dick
And our pockets look like blowfish
And we higher than some voltage
I got Trukfit on my back, bitch
On this Actavis, I'm active
And my acronym is HB
That's for Hot Boy, you a has-been
All this bling, bling, bling, bling, bling
You ain't gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad, squad, squad
You ain't hot like Häagen-Dazs®
Out here thrashin' with my crew
All you hearin' is, "Soo woo"
From New Orleans, that's voodoo
Got a baby with New-New
And I'm smokin' like Badu
Hoodie loc'ing, I'm Piru
No more YMCMB, hocus pocus, bye-bye, poof
Bitch you mothafuckin' right, get a mothafuckin' life
Lil Tunechi out this bitch, drops the mothafuckin' mic
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right

Tunechi and 2 Chainz

Tunechi and 2 Chainz
Fuckin' right
Tell that bitch, "You mothafuckin' right"7Embed
