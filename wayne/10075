7 ContributorsDown South Lyrics
Yeah... scene so thick
Talkin' bout OutKast, Organized, Rap-A-Lot
Nuttin' but that U.G.K
All the playas
All the hustlers
Eightball, MJG, Goodie Mob
Y'all know what it is

See I'm a Southern ass nigga with some Southern ass hoes
A hundred thou cash gets the Southern ass flow
I'm rich bitch no more runnin round cold
Or shootin up windows and gunnin down doors
Oh, yea I think the suckas now know
That the hummer got dropped keep it on the down low
I'm cruisin up highways, stunnin down roads
I'll open up shop then I'm shuttin down shows
Luda cash checks that'll break the bank
Then I'm in the Old School like Frank the Tank
You can't beat me join me, peeps they bore me
But all the Southern asses they keep me horny
Oooh, Big Tymers in a private jet
Got the head of Universal to sign the check
Meanwhile Ludacris is out arrangin rovers
Every coast watch out cuz the south's takin over
Uhh

Ay ay
Weezy the god bow down give praises
I'm easily involved with the drugs in my matrix
Just keepin it calm kickin dust from my laces
I'm puckin a dre in the escalade basic
Don't you fuckin play cuz I escapade faces
Buck fifty a gram quickly I'm real shifty
Come get me I'll be waitin the steel with me
Show appreciation for those who still with me
Throw a heap of gravy at those who still envy
Cuz Weezy f baby all gravy gotta feel me
Heh heh, feel me Lil' Weezy gat go blakah
Feel heat feel sleepy, here's your mattress
Chill, I'm still street deep, I got access
Young and play hard with no practice
Feelin me is like huggin a cactus
But if you know pain you take it love it and patch it

Got Southern type jeans, Southern type shirt
When I drank a lot of beer give a Southern ass burp
Got Southern ass crib, Southern ass car
Down where I'm from I'm a Southern ass star
Got Southern ass chain, Southern ass brain
Where I talk a lotta shit with a Southern ass slang
On any Southern beat got a bunch of Southern freaks
Buck naked outside neighbors callin police
Got a little Southern boy with a little Southern bike
Got a little Southern girlfriend that he'd like
Got a Southern ass truck with a Southern ass dog
Got a big big system knockin pictures off the wall
Got a big Southern party drivin big seven forty
Me and Jazzy Phae cutting on some Southern shortys
I'mma be Southern til the day I go
From my head to my belly to my knees to my toes
I'm a Southern ass nigga that that grew up hard
Uptown third ward nigga blow up a car
I'm the Southern ass nigga with the golds in my mouth
New cars new rims with the work in the drop
I'm a fool, I'm the dude, Mannie fresh the shit
Two ghetto ass niggas now to flip a brick
Well I'm stunna homeboy and I'm filthy rich
Super fly get money in the drop top six
I'm a Southern ass nigga that could blow in the sky
Good weed, twenty threes on that brand new ride
I'm a big money nigga with a boat on the lake
M-I-A and A-T-L we do it state to state
I'm a Southern ass nigga drive fifty whips
Ten bikes customized everything we get
I'm a fly nigga money and my jewels be glistenin
Twenty fours on the Bentley and we blues them bitches nigga

Four on the whips, Southern cousin
Home in the hills, Southern cousin
Chromes and De Villes, Southern cousin
Home cooked meals, Southern cousin
Woooo
When I'm a old school, shine up the wheels
Feet on the mink floors, how does it feel
Wood on the console, chrome on the grill
When you come down here you know what it is
Wooooo
(fade out)
Four on the whips, Southern cousin
Home in the hills, Southern cousin
Chromes and De Villes, Southern cousin
Home cooked meals, Southern cousin1Embed
