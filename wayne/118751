10 ContributorsBandz Lyrics
Oh, what would it take to make you happy?
Don’t hesitate to let me know
Tell me what are you looking for exactly?
Open up your mouth and let a nigga know
Baby would you tell me, please
What I can do to make you smile again
Just say the word and baby I will do
Whatever it takes for me to brighten your day, so baby what do you say?

She told me what she want, ain’t hard to understand
She on that paper chase and need them rubber bands
Now I’m like damn girl you should have said so, what you think I’m stacking these 1’s for?
Get your ass on this dance floor and watch me make this cash flow cause

Bands will make her dance, bands will make her dance
All these chicks popping pussy, I’m just popping bands
Bands will make her dance, bands will make her dance
These chicks clapping and they ain’t using hands

If all that it takes is bands and some cake
Then gon' and take your clothes off, don’t need to make me wait
Girl I can keep you dancing all night if you like
Cause you be working hard, doing everything I like
That’s why I’m gon' get you right, girl I’m gon' get you right
Cause your body look so nice
And you be telling me, tonight I’m gonna dance for you
Baby what can I do for you? Let me know
