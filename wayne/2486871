47 ContributorsI Got a Question Lyrics
I got a que-
Uh

I got a question
When the police gon' stop pressing me?
When my bitch gon' stop stressing me, second guessing me?
Will the truth really set you free?
I got a question
When them boys gon' stop pressing me?
When my girl gon' stop stressing me, second guessing me?
Will the truth really set you free?
I got a question

Look, when them boys gon' stop pressing me?
Can't they tell I'm 'bout my business, I'm Jehovah, you my witness
See me making shit like, uh, for my motherfuckin' children
Gotta pay out all commissions, gotta get it, obtain the vision
Homies switching, shit getting different
I'm making executive decisions
To a broke boy, I never listen, fuck your permission
And 4Hunnid niggas in the building now
Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh, oh, oh Lord
Bitch we go hard, go hard, go hard
To all my niggas above the law
'Cause we don't really fuck with 'em (Fuck wit' 'em), haha
No, my niggas really from the streets
You know they like to blast on Blacks and act like they badge was given from God
That's why I gotta stay with my heat
See YG LiveGet tickets as low as $170You might also like
I got a question
When the police gon' stop pressing me?
When my bitch gon' stop stressing me, second guessing me?
Will the truth really set you free?
I got a question
When them boys gon' stop pressing me?
When my girl gon' stop stressing me, second guessing me?
Will the truth really set you free?
I got a question

Uh, like, when my bitch gon' stop pressing me?
Okay I didn't mean to fuck her, I just had to get my nut off
She was drunk, and I was drunker
(She was a bad motherfucker)
That shouldn't even count though
'Cause I told you I caught that body, that's trust, you shouldn't count those
See me on my bumper 'bout me, barely checking in
I be on my business making sure them checks is in
She think things is changing, she notice we barely fucking
I come and go, when I, when I want, I'm steady hustling
Get the dough, young nigga, get the dough
Young nigga, young nigga, get the dough
Uh, she tell me "Work with me"
I tell her "Bitch, I work the night shift"
She tell me, "Don't fight the feeling," bitch, I'd rather fight it
She like, "This ain't love, how you do me is fucked up, even when I'm fucked up"
Damn, I got a question
When the police gon' stop pressing me?
When my bitch gon' stop stressing me, second guessing me?
Will the truth really set you free?
I got a question (Woop)
When them boys gon' stop pressing me?

When my girl gon' stop stressing me (Yeah), second guessing me?
Will the truth really set you free?

I got a question, what's my name, ho?
I got a few questions, I'ma pick your brain, ho
I'm parlez-vous flexing, I'ma switch the lingo
I'm Piru flexing, all my niggas bang, though (Suu-woop)
That's right (Woop), no question nigga
Shoot first, ask questions second, nigga (Baow)
Got seventeen answers if you test me, nigga
Got a question, where the fuck your weapon, nigga?
Don't talk too much, mind your business, nigga
Hoes talk too much, tryna quiz a nigga (Damn)
Singing cream, getting money like RZA nigga (Cream)
Got a question, who the fuck is these niggas?
We don't talk, we don't fuss, we don't bark or argue
Cock back, point forward like LaMarcus Aldridge
Top back as I ride in the R-uh-R-uh
Got a question, what car I'ma drive tomorrow? Lord
Blah, Tunechi
When the police gon' stop pressing me?
Yeah, YG, fuck with me
When my bitch gon' stop stressing me, second guessing me?
Will the truth really set you free? (Mula, baby)

When them boys gon' stop pressing me? (Huh?)
When my girl gon' stop stressing me (Huh?), second guessing me? (Huh?)
Will the truth really set you free?
