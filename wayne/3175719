5 ContributorsTake Your Girl Lyrics
Now shawty got a man, but I got a plan
Look, homie, I ain't trying to force your hand
But I'ma take your girl
I'ma take your girl

And I can tell you, she wants me
She wants me, she wants me, she wants me
And yes I want her too
I'ma take your girl

I swear to you every time I sees her, I seizure
Keep running through my mind, jog my memories; amnesia
Touch ya, tease ya, nervous? Don't freeze up
She let me take control, I run a woman like a Visa
She always run back to me saying he's a dog
Off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her, "Take a breather"
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches, but money's over her
'Cause money's under nothing, my life is such a blur
It's not the way it has to go, it's just what I prefer
And any Young Money nigga I know would concur
Weezy, talk to 'em!

And she wants me
She wants me yeah
And I want her too
Yeah, I want her too

I'm talkin' 'bout shawty got something about her
Shawty got this thing about her
Shawty got that thing that make you wannna wrap a ring around her
Wanna rap and sing about her
So thats what I does, shit that's what it was
They rub my back in the tub it was me
Yeah, we all buddies
And shawty gots a husband, and everyone knows but him
But fuck him

And I can tell you, she wants me
She wants me, she wants me, she wants me
And yes I want her too
I'ma take your girl

Shawty got a man, but I got a plan
Listen, homie, I ain't trying to force your hand
But I'ma take your girl
I'ma take your girl
And her girls and they girls
Comin' with me yeah, talkin' one on three yeah
They ain't playin no D yeah
Thats cause they playin for me yeah

Just as long as we know whats good on both ends
I'm loving ya like I'm ya man though we just friends
If ya shy come see me for ya comfortin' I got a comfortable suite at the Comfort Inn
I tell her
I don't own a boat baby but I can float
And I don't own a plane but there's a mary jane and we can float
Your man ain't worrying about what's going on over here
You could get penalized the way you blowin' below the rear
Now this game like a analog I don't sweat cause it show how fake you are
She stressin', ya she testin' ya, she just tryin' to see what kinda level ya on
You don't make it bounce like a basketball, you ain't even get no ass at all
Now you sittin at the club trying to laugh it off, she done found her mid glam boy
You messin up, you messed up, wasn't easy to clean your Mess up
She found me and I blessed her, I applied to her pressure
She call me a professor, I went gave her her lecture
I bet she says I'm better, than her man was ever

Shawty got a man, but I got a plan
Look, homie, I ain't trying to force your hand
But I'ma take your girl
I'ma take your girl
 (x2)
And I can tell you, she wants me
She wants me, she wants me, she wants me
And yes I want her too
I'ma take your girlEmbed
