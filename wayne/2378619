39 ContributorsNo Reason Lyrics
If young Freeway don't trust you, I'm gon' murk ya

I told my homie I'll be back, I got some hoes that tryna see me
I'll be double cupping, letting bitches double team me
All this fuckin' smoke around a nigga like a genie
Lord, these hoes be schemin', just to get some Neimans
Just to get some Niemans, so I be playing defense
Nowadays these hoes want you to fuck 'em and feed them
Now we at the drive thru, I'm forever Piru
I'm forever connected like AOL and Yahoo, okay
I just be fightin' my demons
I just be righteous or evil
I don't be Skypin' or streamin'
I just be high for no reason
I just be Tunechi or Weezy
I just eat cuchi, I'm greedy
Give me the Uzi, I'll squeeze it
Last night was a movie, I seen it
And I just be high for no reason
I just be high for no reason
And I just be high for four seasons
'Round here you can die for no reason
These bitches on diets and vegans
She getting it tight for next season
And me, I'm just high for no reason
And you, you could die for no reason
You might also like
I know some niggas pull triggas
That don't value life but put prices on people
My homie name Vic
Because he a stealer but used to be nice with them eagles
I know what she do for that Niemans
Yeah, she move that cuchi for profit
That pussy a Uzi she pop it
I'm in this bitch with Lil Tunechi, what's poppin'?
You could die on my block, nigga, that shit is trill
That clip open up, you get fucked, call it Netflix and chill
He see what his girl do that, that chump might just panic
A crew full of sea men had sunk the Titanic
She suck and fuck or die
Fuck you fuckers, suckers, knuckle up a riot
Homie like Donkey Kong, bundle up them pies
Whipping out them barrels, pistol white as pearl
My bitch so perfect, I nut in that pussy, she piss it out in pearls
No sheets on my bed, just a lot of girls
And I just be fly for no reason
Yeah I just be fly for no reason
They kill my pop at sixteen
Sometimes a nigga just cry for no reason
I used to steal out of Niemans
Now I'm so rich this shit feel like I'm dreamin'
Gotta hit mute on the phone when I talk to you
‘Cause I still got your bitch screamin'
She play with that pussy
FaceTime a nigga with Jodeci on ‘cause she fiendin'
That pussy get killed for no reason
You pussies can die for no reason
You pussies can die for no reason
I just get high for no reason
The world be tryna get over
I just get high to get even, yeah
Yellin', that shit was ill, that shit was trill
Had to tell my bitch stop stealing and stashing my pills
That bitch a addict for real
That bitch a addict for real
That bitch is nasty for real, she naked in heels
Fuck Tom, Dick, and Harry and Bill
Sonya, Sarah and Jill, I carry the steel
In anyone area still
‘Cause shit could get scary for real, I'm aware and I'm skilled
I had to bury some mills somewhere in a field
Please don't ask me where, my lips sealed
Very concealed, I got whatever you feel
I got blow like Derek Foreal
I got that white like Jaleel
I'm 'bout that life and that's real
I'm 'bout that life and that's real
I say that twice ‘cause that's real
Sometimes it's like I just feel like ain't nothing easy
I'ma get high for that reason
And you could still die for no reason, die for no reason
I just be fightin' my demons
I just be lightin' my cheeba
I just be Tunechi or Weezy
I'm so excited to be him
We kill you on sight just for breathin'
'Round here you can die for your Visa
'Round here you can die for a pizza
'Round here we don't die for no divas
And I just be high for no reason
I just be high for no reason
They kill my pop at fourteen
Sometimes a nigga just cry for no reason
'Round here you can die with your homie
'Round here you can die by your lonely
We come on your side for no reason
Shoot it up and then smile when we leavin'
You could still die for no reason
I be getting high for no reason
The world it be tryna get over
I be getting high to get even
I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no feelings
And you all in your feelings
I'm like, "Fuck your feelings"
You know I ain't got no ceilings8Embed
