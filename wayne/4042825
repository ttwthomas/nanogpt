14 ContributorsMillion Dollar Question Lyrics
Eardrummers!
You outchea fuckin' for a check
I'm outchea juugin for a check

Girl you know my love on autopilot
I tell you "I love you", you be quite
I tell you "I love you", you deny it
You tell me to buy it, I get quiet

And you say "Why you actin' funny with all of that money?"
I say "Why you actin' bad with all of that ass?"
She say "Why you actin' funny with all of that money?"
I say "Why you actin' bad with all of that ass?"
'Cause I know you do some strange for a little change
You outchea fuckin' for a check, he need your real name
I'm outchea juugin' for a check, I'm on a night train
I'm zoomin in the fast lane, he in the bike lane

Bum bum, these niggas they so whomp whomp
Watchin' me and all they missin' is some pom poms
I got her pussy, numb numb, she say "uh huh"
Cellulite all on that ass, I call it lump sumps
But baby girl, tell me why you actin' funny
Every time I come around, you gotta ask me for money
See really, trickin' off ain't my thing
But I might give you somethin' if you change the game
Now, the only money I probably spend
Is on holidays, like Holiday Inn
And girl I can see it all over your face
That make up ain't making up for the mistakes
You know one thing, you ain't gettin' no money
You stump with your friends and all of them wan' fuck me
You actin' bad, you know I don't get mad
'Cause you know that I don't get mad, I get money
I know these hoes don't get mad, they get even
You know I can't get too mad, I'm too money
Plus I know there's too many dyin' to meet me
Plus the way I put this D down
You hoes should be paying me now
But I'm priceless
Preach
You might also like
She say "Why you actin' funny with all of that money?"
Why you actin' bad with all of that ass?
Why you actin' bad with all of that ass?
I give your ass a bath with all of this cash
'Cause I know you do some strange for a little change
You outchea fuckin' for a check, he need your real name
Million dollar man, million dollar flexin'
Million dollar question, million dollar question

"Why you actin' funny with all that money?"
I say "Why you actin' bad with all that ass?"

She say "Why you actin' funny with all that money?"
I say "Why you actin' bad with all that ass?"
She say "Why you actin' funny?" - "Why you actin' funny?"
Girl why you actin' bad? All that for nothin'
See I gave you my love. Was all that for nothin'?
She say "Y'all the same. Y'all after somethin'."
Wait, baby hold up, baby wait a minute
Don't confuse me with these niggas, I done got offended
Don't confuse me with these niggas, I done got offended
I let you keep the receipt for all that time I'm spendin', shit
Girl you know my love on autopilot
I tell you I love you, you get quiet
I tell you about you, you deny it
You tell me to buy it, I get quiet

'Cause I know you do some strange for a little change
You outchea fuckin' for a check, he need your real name
You outchea fuckin' for a check
I'm outchea juugin' for a check, girl

You outchea fuckin' for a check
I'm outchea juugin' for a check, girl
I'm outchea juugin' for a check, girl

She say "Why you actin' funny with all that money?"
I say "Why you actin' bad with all that ass?"
She say "Why you actin' funny?" - "Why you actin' funny?"
Why you actin' bad? Why you actin' bad?
Why?
Oh why?
