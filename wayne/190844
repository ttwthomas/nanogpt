It ain't nothin but cigars, audemars
Got so many foreigns, you need a passport to walk in my garage
It ain't nothin', nigga, ain't nothin', nigga
Take a lifetime to spend money this long, nigga, we been on
Uh, nigga, we been on, we done came up
From them red cups to them gold bottles, livin' on islands, caked up, uh
It ain't nothin', nigga, ain't nothin', nigga
Stuntin' on niggas and taking their broads

Okay, you know that we be in the club all night, throwin' up this money
Got my niggas to my right, throwin' up this money
Yeah these bitches know what I like, all about my money
Gotta get this money; what you talking 'bout nigga? We been on, yeah
Nigga, we been on, yeah

Okay, I'm getting high in this bitch, I'm O-mas in this bitch

I got my red cup in this bitch, yeah I'm turnt up in this bitch
I say "fuck your dress code", I got my J's on in this bitch
I'm ballin' hard in this bitch, I brought my A game to this bitch
And I would take your girl but I got the baddest chick in this bitch
And I got her up all night fuckin' her to my love songs
She know she know all my love songs, smoke some
