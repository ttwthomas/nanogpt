Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor

Hit me on the celly, watching Belly
God's son, I can see they study Makaveli
Peanut butter Benz, got 'em jelly at the deli
If you feelin' like a ninja, I got a machete
Hell yeah, them girls bad, but I'm fuckin' heavy
I'ma fuck around and have 'em lookin' like spaghetti
I say some shit, he be like, "Yo, you so legendary"
But he can tell just by my face, he ain't gettin' any, kyuh

Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh, boy
She was making that noise, oh, boy
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh, boy
She was making that noise, oh, boy

Meet me at the Rucker, take the Bruckner
It's just me and Young Yucka, takin' suckers
For they money and they whips, puttin' kitten on lips
Dividin' them dividends, get the money and dip
Keys to the nigga's safe, put it under my tits
He got ki's of that raw, it could fit in the six
Got a UPS connect, so we good on them trips
Automatic bottle service so we good in them VIPs, nigga
You might also like
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh, boy
She was making that noise, oh, boy
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh, boy
She was making that noise, oh, boy

These civilians
What up, nigga? Excuse my millions
I-I-I'm in the V like a widow's peak
It's just me and my Rolls Royce pillow seats
Why they starin' at me? I brung McLaren with me
Yo, matter of fact, I think I'ma bring Donna Karan with me
And you my son, I'on't know, it's just the parent in me
I am the best, I am the queen, it's so apparent in me
I'm in Hollywood with Shia Labeouf
Most of you rappers ain't eatin', that diet is rough
You want some hot shit? Send that wire to us
I'll make 'em change they name to Diddy, retire the puff
I'm gettin' actin' money
You niggas is Kevin Hart, y'all be actin' funny
I'ma a keep a linebacker, tell 'em tackle for me
Yo, you seen my last pic, go double-tap that for me
Cock back
Red octagon, stop that
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh, boy
She was making that noise, oh, boy
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh, boy
She was making that noise, oh, boy82Embed
