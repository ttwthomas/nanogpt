6 ContributorsDedication After Disaster Lyrics
Now, listen, man. This right here is dedicated to all the young motherfuckers all across the world, especially in my city: New Orleans, man. I r— I—I respect how y'all hold y'all head and y'all stand strong after disaster, you know what I mean? You hold your head high after disaster. Not only my city; there's every city, and there's every young'un'—not every young'un', but almost every young'un'—or, there's a young'un' everywhere who's been through or went through their own disaster, or who's going through their own personal disaster. But, not to— not to over-— not to undermine my city, you know what I mean? We went through a tough one, and I wanna— I wanna let the young motherfuckers know that I see y'all, nigga. I see y'all, nigga. Getting money in different cities, nigga. Getting money in different ways, nigga. Respect my city, nigga. Respect a New Orleanian when you see him in your motherfucking face, nigga. Straight like that, man, 'cause if they don't, nigga, I'll make you respect me.You might also likeEmbed
