1 ContributorICE Lyrics
You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Baby, your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot

Pull up, she been purring like a kitten
Craving your love
I've been counting on the days you been gone
A little too long, patient
Knowing exactly what it is
It lasts, time, and now
When you, come and lay between at this time
Take the ice cube (boy you know what)
Sit it right below my navel
And watch what I do
And that's my favorite angle
My legs are numb now
Your loving be giving me chills

You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Baby your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
You might also like
You put the pillow (Right thеre)
Underneath my back
Got mе up against the window (Right now)
We got no shame we going I
He hates it when I use my hands
He got me saying, 'Damn, my man knows what he's doing'
The mirrors, the mirrors
Up on the ceiling, got things so visual, so visual
Babe I ain't never feel so right yeah
He comes again my body going numb
Hot as ice, can't get enough

You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Baby your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot

Uh, ice, ice baby
Shake that ass just like dice baby
You hot and I'm Tunechi
I beat the cat, animal cruelty
I'm colder than your man
He should be your ex now
Throw that ass back like we playing pitch and catch (Fuckin' right)
And all your hear is what's my name, it's yo pussy
Sweet tooth roll tussy
If you are what you eat, I'm so pussy
I'm skating on thin ice
I put in her windpipe, we do it til we both exhausted
Twin pipes, pillow under her stomach
The other pillow she bite
Would you like anything
Cause i'll do anything you like
I make her freeze up
Pick her knees up, she want a mad nigga
Watch me clean up, I know where to put it
I put it in her life
I leave that pussy smoking
Smoking like ice
You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Baby, your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Baby, your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hotEmbed
