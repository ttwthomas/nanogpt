Yeah
Yeah, yeah (Ah)
Oh, oh yeah
Mm-mm

The way you hypnotized me, I could tell (Uh)
You've been in control
You manifested this, but girl, I blame myself
Things I shoulda known
The whispers that I hear
Are blowin' through my ears
These words I need to hear from you
And I know this is a fling
But you're hidin' someone's ring
It hurts to think I'm sharin' you

Ooh, I heard you're married, girl
I knew that this was too good to be true
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh

If you don't love him (Oh no)
Then do yourself a favor and just leave him
Your number in my phone, I'm gon' delete it
Girl, I'm way too grown for that deceivin'
'Cause I don't play, I don't play
Now I'm sure you have your issues and your reasons (Reasons)
But why you even with him if you're cheatin'? (Cheatin')
And I thought you were someone that I could be with (Yeah)
And it kills me that I'm sharin' you

Oh, I heard you're married, girl
I knew that this was too good to be true
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh
And I hate it
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl (Married, girl)
The way you had me wrapped around your finger too
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh

I can't be with you
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl, oh (Ooh)
I can't be with you (Yeah)
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl
Oh, yeah

Can't be your side bitch
That shit ain't fly, bitch
Can't be your pilot
Can't be your private
Make me your obvious
If I ain't your husband, I can't be your hybrid
I heard you're married
I bet he treats you like Virgin Mary
You like it dirty and I'm Dirty Harry
I thought we were some love birds, canaries, word to Larry
But I can't fuck with you
You put my love on the line and then hang up on you
That's a long kiss goodbye, I gotta tongue kiss you
And when doves cry, we ain't got enough tissue
I'm still in love with you
Where the love at?
You walk down the aisle, I can make you run back
Like, fuck that, where the love at?
And tell hubby I'll kill him, no hub cap
Woah, woah (Woah, woah)
Oh, I heard you're married, girl (Married, girl)
I knew that this was too good to be true
Oh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh (Woah, woah)
And I hate it (Oh, I hate it)
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl (Married, girl)
The way you had me wrapped around your finger too (Your finger too)
Oh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh (I heard you're married, and baby, I hate it)

I can't be with you
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl, oh (Ooh)
I can't be with you (Yeah)
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl (Ooh, ooh)
I can't be with you (Oh yeah)
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl, oh (Talk to me, say)
I can't be with you
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl (Ooh)16Embed
