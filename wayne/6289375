24 ContributorsLayaway Lyrics
Put some Actavis on layaway
Too much cash, ain't no more table space, yeah
I've been practicing my fade away, I'm shootin'
I'm an assassin, don't get JFK'd, shoot him (Bap!)

Put some Actavis on layaway, yeah
Too much cash, ain't no more table space, yeah
I've been practicing my fade away
I'm faded off this Actavis, just call it faderade, okay, okay

My lil' plastic bitch wanna lay all day, bitch, you fake
Fuck that nasty bitch then fade away, hit the J
Tell that natural bitch to stay that way, bitch, you great
Tell that dancer bitch to pay her way, yeah, yeah

I sip some Ac' and go way away
I take a nap and I wake and bake
I be so litty, I radiate
She said, "Don't you go breaking my achy-break"
I don't fuck with niggas no way, no way
Stay away, far away or the Tommy spray
Chef with the Draco, I'm Bobby Flay
Blood on my apron, my pots and plates
Throw your ass in the grave like a microwave
The oven, the basement, the fireplace
Throw my flag in the air, no United States
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You might just swallow a tidal wave
And you might just swallow my mayonnaise
I'm mixing this codeine all kind of ways
Lit like Johnny Blaze
You might also like
And you know that roses are red, I know that hundreds are blue
I like my presidents dead, buried somewhere in my room
And all your Victoria red, and I like that color on you
You look like blood money, I'm a vampire, coming for you

Yeah, yeah, put some Actavis on layaway
Yeah, yeah, too much cash, ain't no more table space
I've been practicing my fade away
Faded off this Actavis, just call it faderade, okay, okay

Too much coke, too many razorblades, hold up, wait
Snorting white way after Labor Day, yeah, yeah
Like our last day is a day away, yeah, yeah
I’d rather spend the night than save the day
I put some Actavis on layaway
I got this rachet pointin' at your fuckin' database
Stay in place, all of this ammo like the navy base
'Cause day-to-day, me and them bluefaces be face-to-face
Ball like Macy Gray, like Macy Gray, like Macy Gray
Bought my place a place, my safe a safe, my bae a bae
I smoke L.A. all day, I pop a Addy, stay awake
I'm with gorillas that'd kill you for some Bathing Apes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She know that roses are red, I know that hundreds are blue
I like my presidents dead, buried somewhere in my room
All your Victoria red, and I like that color on you
You look like blood money, this vampire suckin' his tooth, ooh

Put some Actavis on layaway, yeah, yeah
Too much cash, ain't no more table space, yeah, yeah
I've been practicing my fade away, I'm shootin'
I'm an assassin don't get JFK'd, okay, okay

My lil' plastic bitch wanna lay all day, bitch, you fake
Fuck that nasty bitch then fade away, hit the J
Tell that natural bitch she tailor-made, bitch, you great
Tell that dancer bitch to pay her way, yeah, yeah

I sip some Ac' and go way away
I take a nap and I wake and bake (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I be so litty, I radiate
She said, "Don't you go breaking my achy-break" (Moolah, baby)
I don't fuck with niggas no way, no way
Stay away, far away or the Tommy spray
(I'd rather spend the nights than save the day, yeah, yeah)
One time for Hollygrove, New Orleans
