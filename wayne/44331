Bounce! I'm somethin like a phenomenon
The steerin wheel cost a mill that my arm is on
I don't tell no time cause my time is wrong
I just use it for a settin for diamonds on
Listen pull up to the club and make the whole club STOP (STOP)
Now go to the floor and make the whole club DROP (DROP)
And tell the DJ I ain't never 'gon STOP (STOP)
And anything here you ain't never 'gon cop
Listen, peek-a-boo when I'm speakin at you
And her Victoria's Secrets that I'm seein through
You say that's your girlfriend are you meetin her too?
You say you want more fun with me and my crew, come on!!!

Yo, I wanna rock right now (BUS!!)
Bussa Bus and I came to wear the crown (HO!)
I told niggas to get down or lay down (HO!)
While I bag bitches from New York to K-Town (HO!)
Gilette razor sharp, bitch, you never see me sloppy (HO!)
No matter wht you try to do, you can't stop me (C'mon Bus!)
If you know what's good for you homie - walk, nigga walk (Hands up!)
While I come through, when I give you boss, nigga talk
As you can see, I'm only here to flood more drugs (yeah)
Through every hood watch a nigga RUN every plugs (You remember!)

 (Part of Swizz Beatz chorus)
(She said she'll take it all off.......)
Ted take the hook out, take the hook out, take the hook out
I go by the name of Swizzy, I got my homeboy Cross from Harlem
He 'gon talk to y'all, FREEZE!!!!!!!!
 (Swizz Beatz]
Mama, shake it, but don't break it
All the girls give it to me, I don't chase it (HO!)
I got ones, now all my money need a face lift (HARLEM!!)
Cars in the garage, chicks pullin menage
Kid need a massage, grindin so large
Swizzy, Cross, and Bus, now call up Weezy
I rep the streets, that's why they feed me
You ain't seen Harlem, 'til I'm on TV
Now let me see you Dougie (Dougie), let me see you Wop
Now do the Luke for me, and let ya rump pop
Non-stop, action baby
When they hear this in the club then they gon' go crazy (to the flo!)
I don't like when they lay there and act all lazy
'til I put love in them den they act all crazy
Blowin up my phone like a bill collector
When I hit her like Jody, she gon cook me breakfast
I wanna rock right...
I wanna rock right...{*music fades*]1Embed
