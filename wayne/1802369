4 ContributorsWelcome To My Hood Lyrics
Welcome to my hood
(Where the hood at)
(Where the hood at)
Welcome to my hood
Everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood
Look at all these old school Chevy’s
24′s so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood
They outside playing hopscotch
And every know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood
Them boys will put you down on your knees
(Woop, woop) That’s the sound of the police
In my hood
Audemar on my wrist
Diamond, look like they glowing
50 stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin’
Treat ‘em like jack boys, catch ‘em slippin’ then slay ‘em
Lord forgive me for my sins
That’s my confessions if they put me in this benz
I got possession of a federal offence
I’m talking pressure in my criminal intent
So wear ya vest’s and I’m still gon’ stunt
Like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck ya house note nigga
Blow that bitch on a bottle
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back
Tell you “we the best forever” DJ Khaled handle that
You might also like
I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Norieaga
I’m talkin’ Norieaga, nigga, the real Norieaga
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us
And tell congress when you see ‘em bitch I’m stealin’ cable
And leave the D-Boys alone ’cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers
Some are on house arrest, some are on child support
Some of ‘em did they bit, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr Landlord we gon bust your ass with an eviction note
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo
I’m talking strip clubs, I’m talking liquor stores
We throw our money round here, but y’all can…

Bitch I’m on probation, so my nerves bad
And they say time fly’s, well mine’s first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell 23, tell the warden kiss my ass
Pockets on Monique
Bitch I’m from the murder capital
Hoe, I’m far from practical
Shit happens and since I’m the shit, I’m who it happens to
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I’m red hot
I don’t see nobody, see nobody like a head shot
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out
Got it sewn up, check the thread count
