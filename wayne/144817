 Ohhh, ohhh

You can be my cuddy, cuddy buddy fo' sho (you can ride with me)
Girl, don't act like you don't already know (act like you don't see)
We can get it on the bed or the floor (don't matter to me, girl)
I wanna take you to, H-Town

MIKE JONES~!
Girl, if you need this here, call me, don't have no fear
I wanna (love you down, la-la-love you down)
Late night's a lovey-dovey, some wanted to love, to love me
She's somethin' like a friend, call her my cuddy buddy
Even though she got a man (oh), she already know the plan (oh)
She already know the deal, so what the business here?
Even though she (got a man), she already (know the plan)
She already know the deal, know the deal, know the deal
Even though I'm chubby, chubby (chubby), your chick, she love me, love me (love me)
She might be with you now, but she still thinkin' of me
Y'all out there making love (love), our cuddy make 'em love me
In the back of the 'Llac, buddy, just like, that (ohhh, ohhh)
You might also like
 + (Trey Songz)
How you do your lips like that, move your hips like that, work your ass like that? (like that)
Why you make noise like that, move slow like that, fuck fast like that? (like that)
Baby, I ain't gon' lie to you (yeah), we so sexually compatible (yeah)
How I thrill myself, like I kill myself, when I feel myself inside of you (yeah)
You can be my cutty buddy, nibble on my Nutty Buddy, while we do some freaky things with the lights on
Touchin' on you while I'm listenin' to T-Pain (whoa-ohh), huggin' on you while I'm listenin' to Mike Jones (whoa-ohh)
Do it soon as we got in the sack, or I could hit it in the 'Llac, offa fifth of the yak
Like (like), like (like), that
 + (Trey Songz)
It's the middle of the night, y'all got into a fight, now you mad with your feelings hurt
Girl, let me buy you a drank, please tell me what you thank right before I get up in them skirts
(Skeet, skeet) I pull up in a 'Llac truck, (beep, beep) my mean shawty back up
(Feed me) If your man act up, he poor time, girl, I'll be the backup
Cause I'm your cuddy buddy, cud-cud-cud-cuddy buddy
Soon as he fall asleep, she on her way to love me
Cause I'm your cuddy buddy, cud-cud-cud-cuddy buddy
Soon as he fall asleep, she on her way to love me
Cause she know that I (got that wood), and she know that my (sex is good)
We can do it on the bed or the floor (girl) cause you know that I keep it hood
And she know that I (got that wood), and she know that my (sex is good)
We can do it on the bed or the floor, let me know, ay (ohhh, ohhh)

 + {Trey Songz}
AOOOWWW... Young Weezy Baby~!
See, I can't be her man {man}, and she can't be my girl {girl}
But we do it like it's the end of the world, ya dig?
We have relations like I'm kin to the girl
I make her holla like when momma brought her into the world
Look, I'll let him buy you dinner tonight {yeah}
Then at the end of the night {yeah}, you be my dinner tonight {dinner tonight}
Ha, you see, he dark, he always dim in his light
And that girl, wanna shine, I bring her into the light
Voila, I become her Allah
And I swear that thang feel like la, la, la {La-la-la, la}
And since he feed her lies (What you do)
I be her dessert on the side, yeah (ohhh, ohhh)
