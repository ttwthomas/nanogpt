Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
P-P-P-Poker face, p-p-poker face
No Ceilings
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (Cut the music up, please! Yeah)
P-P-P-Poker face, p-p-poker face
Ahem

Um, she say— say can fuck me right
I made her fuck her friend
She said, "Don’t call her a dyke"
But that's gay, ha!

I met her on Monday and fucked her all week
'Cause every time she leave, she come back to the tree
She know I love brain so I treat her like a geek
She love the way I spit, so I made the pussy gleek
Wild'n' with my niggas, and I don’t give a fuck
So I circle the bitches, we rounding 'em up
I treat her like I need her, I'm knowing if I eat her
She gon' tell Quita, and Quita like the media
"Woopty-woop" to the Bloods
Her lipstick match my flag—that's swag
Weezy F. Baby got nuts that drag
I put 'em in your mouth 'til you choke and gag

Oh, oh-oh, oh (Hahaha)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
P-P-P-Poker face (I poke her face off, and now, she faceless)
P-P-Poker face (I poke her so much, I deserve a bracelet)
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Ahhhhh!)
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (Haha! Young Money!)
P-P-P-Poker face (I poke— I poke her face off, and now, she faceless)
P-P-Poker face (And I just gave "Poke Her Face" a facelift)
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh

Chi-Town girl (What?), bag match her heels
Her ass hella fake, but it feel real (Ha!)
And it felt great when we had sex
I tore her out the frame, like pics of my ex
From my aspect, I love your assets (Ha)
I love your mini-skirt (Why?) It's easy access
Pipe game never mediocre
So that relationship is over once I poke her
She said she wanted a tour of the tour bus ("So what you do?")
So I gave her a tour of the tour bus ("Who was there?")
It was all us on the tour bus (Ha!)
And she did all us ("Where?") On the tour bus, like...

Oh, oh-oh, oh (Hahaha)
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Ha! Le' go!)
P-P-P-Poker face
P-P-P-Poker face (Um, I make her say...)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
P-P-P-Poker face
P-P-P-Poker face
P-P-P-Poker face
P-P-Poker face
