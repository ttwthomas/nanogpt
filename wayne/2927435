25 ContributorsTrill Lyrics
Blunt, pass the weed to the next nigga
My bitch dyed her hair red for the set, nigga
She a trill ass hoe and I'm the trillest nigga
I'll feel the holy ghost before I feel these niggas
I got these bitches on they toes, no Achilles, nigga
Spit on your grave, throw a rose and some lilies, nigga
I know the stove like I worked at Piccadilly's, nigga
I wear a gold rope for old Mississippi niggas
And I was locked up in a hole, I could've killed me, nigga
And then a guard gave me some head, she felt guilty, nigga
I brush my teeth a hundred times just to grill these niggas
And I just walked up in the bank humming "A Milli", nigga
Whoa, trill nigga just walked in the bank
Plenty fish in the sea but I'm the shark in the tank
Your business in the streets and your broad in my face
And your mama turn tricks and your homies turn state
And my homies turn weight to some cake, for real
I get paid all day, lump sums, oatmeal
Oh yeah, I feel like Neo on both pills
Balling on these bitches like Shaquille O'Trill, Tune

Cause all my life, I've been a trill nigga
I bet we deal with him
Cause all my life, I've been a trill nigga
I bet we deal with him
See YG LiveGet tickets as low as $170You might also like
I used to be a dirty motherfucker
Now I got my own shit
I'm from west side California, we the realest state
I left the house like "mom, I'm on my own shit"
What's the plan? See, the plan is to stack 100 grand
Turn 100 grand to a million
Turn that million to a billion, turn that billion to a trillion
Cause all my life, I've been a trill nigga
I go get it, keep a .40 cal with me
I ain't no industry nigga, all my life, I've been a trill nigga
Who got problems? Cause my whole clique ride and
Point the bitch nigga out, I bet we deal with him
I done had a fucked up deal for my four plus years
But in God I trust, Lord, I'm still with ya
I'm 'bout to bounce back on these niggas like Derrick Rose
Here it go, here-here it go, here-here it go
2016, picture me in a big house with the biggest screen
With niggas I knew since the age of sixteen
Plotting to ride for these niggas and it's cold in the street
I know all you niggas head cold ass lil meat
Bold ass lil weed with goals, that's me
Let's rob 'em right now, that's for sure, that's me
Run up in they shit, they like "Lord, have mercy"
I'm thinking "Lord, let this be a smooth ass burglary"
Cause all my life, I've been a trill nigga
I bet we deal with him
Cause all my life, I've been a trill nigga (I'm trill)
I bet we deal with him (so trill)
Cause all my life, I've been a trill nigga (I'm trill)
Cause all my life, I've been a trill nigga (I'm trill)
Cause all my life, I've been a trill nigga
(Cause all my life, I've been a trill nigga)
Yeah, I only fuck with trill niggas
I bet we deal with him13Embed
