118 ContributorsUptown Lyrics
Yeah
Uh-huh

Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
See Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, "Drake is just a younger you"
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you, bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout?
Young Mula, baby

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on32Embed
