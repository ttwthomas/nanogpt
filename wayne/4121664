1 ContributorMe u & hennessy LyricsCan we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
This drink got me feelin' right
I’m 'bout to lose my mind
U, Me, & Hennessy, look what you did to me
Fuckin' so crazy, you twirlin’ and spinnin' me
My head keep on spinnin', my legs keep on shakin'
But my head keep on spinnin'
I'm out of my mind lets keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies, and make it official
I feel you inside, no better feelin’
I throw it back, and you catch my driftin’
You shiftin' inside, you got me screamin’
You got me, yellin' out yo name oooh I need you
You kiss on my thighs, and then you eat it
Pause for a minute, then I let you beat it
I lovin' this ride, smooth like a beamer
Smooth like that henny, this what happens when we drinkin'
I’m not going to lie, you got me speechless
Got 69, more than 25 reasons
Me, Hennessy & U
Me, Hennessy & U
Me, Hennessy & U
Me, Hennessy & U
U, Me & Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy & U
Me, Hennessy & U
You might also likeU, Me & Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy & U
Me, Hennessy & U
Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
Don't wear your thong tonight
No Trojan on tonight
Oh Lord I usually don't do this
But I'm a go and get the quarter goin'
Ignore the phone and the car alarm
Hold up, I'm 'bout to cum, no, false alarm
Makeup off, no weave, glasses off
Codeine, Adderall, it's a pussy marathon
Girl you don't love me, you just love my doggystyle
Put this dick up in your mouth while you're talkin'
Like what you talkin' 'bout?
Yeah cause you've been talkin', no more talkin'
While I make us a drink, and I don't drink
So when you're not lookin' I pour some out in the sink
Babe, I guess chemistry is true
But I don't know if it's the Hennessy or you
I heard you eat pussy too and I'm feelin' that
I hope your girlfriend feelin' me too
I'ma fuck her real good right next to you
Then look at you like it's finna be you
Me, Hennessy and you, and you
Couple candles
No TV's reporting bad news, it's just me , Hennessy and you
Some fast food, and you gonna act a damn fool on this good wood
This bamboo
You, me and Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy and you
Me, Hennessy and you
You, me and Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy and you
Me, Hennessy and youEmbed
