4 ContributorsThink It’s A Game Lyrics
I got my fitted brim leanin
The boy walk taller than kareem
Should i spend some green on these jeans mister
Im just a small nigga
Im like a buck fifty
But really im a hundred flat and my nuts fifty
Im like a buck ninety five when im totin a gun
And with my ice and bank card i weight over a ton
One more brick a git me over tha hump
2 more charges git me shipped up and roll with a bump
Im in the crib sittin over tha pump
Watchin face make me think that i control where im from
Im the eastland lord baby
Thats my name
From down gon miss you man thats my range
We a pound you forget you and
Stash your remains
See them sqad dudes is vicious and
Thats my game
Can you count ta a hundred thosand
Thats my chain
Not my piece
I said thats my chain
Gats and thangs
And mamis name
Play tha game how it was designated
Varieted but every made it in the city ate it
Can i fade it you niggas fake this shit is animated
Dont get us aggravated body parts git amputated
Im young baby comin through crazy
Birdman attitude fuck you pay me
Came from a magnet skool
Started totin magnum tools
Daddy im a platinum dude
Put me out on any day watch that platinum move
See me on the interstate watch that platinum move
Im so cool i let my bitch wear my platinum jewels
She got tha jlo shorts and tube with air force 2s
Ima baller baby - i know you want a baller baby
How you want it bitch
My spoiler 80
My rims is 20
The ones that keep spinning and shit
My grill 5 it be grinnin and shit
Im fresh like im buyin mintin and shit
Weezy you keep killin this shit
