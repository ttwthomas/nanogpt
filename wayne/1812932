1 ContributorHow To Love (Remix) LyricsCut the music up
A lil' louder
Yeah
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love
When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios
Me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar?
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?
Te acuerdas de esa noche eramos adolescentes queria darte un beso
Y tu tan inocente me tenias locamente enamorado, me tenias locamente enamorado
Y ya lo ves, lo que fue ya fue te marchaste poco a poco de mi lado y yo sigo locamente enamorado aqui sigo locamente enamorado
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber amar como amar?
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar
Ooohh, see I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeahh
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual
How to love
You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
La vida va pasando tu carita no a cambiado
Esos ojitos negros que siguen suplicando como amar como amar?You might also likeEmbed
