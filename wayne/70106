10 ContributorsWhat He Does Lyrics
Yea, but she always say, but she love my style
And if I stay out late I'm coming home rich
Thinking bout that pussy on the grind got me home sick
Them dollar signs on my mind got me on this
If I don't hustle then what happens in the morning
Do the sun even rise, do the birds sing
When I can stand over the stove and make the birds sing
You think about that I'll be right back, ring
There she go baby call right back click, ring
Then she call right back click, ring
I toss the phone in the back, quick think
Shit you all I got, but if you leave me where you left me than be on that clock
Gettin' it, and when a nigga hittin' it you lovin'
No crying no fussing, just a simple I'm coming
So when you baby boy out there running
Don't cry don't fuss it's simple I'm coming

I know what he does
(I know what he does)
But ohh I'm in love (so in love)
(My baby), that's my baby, have his baby someday
And yes it's hard (so hard, ohhh)
But that's my baby
And I love him, I love him yall

Yea, I roll up on her in that earth toner
She can smell the work on me when I work on her
I see through that smurk on her, it hurts sort of
But I been in to deep since my first order
I just tell her don't expect the worst
She say she don't wanna be stuck standing next to a nurse
I say I don't wanna be stuck standing next to a curb
She said she don't wanna, I say shut up you pressing my nerves
She say, who you telling shut up, then she get up
Start packing her shit up, start calling her sister
Sister dosen't pick up, the tension start to pick up
She crying, she got hiccups, I'm tellin her to cheer up
I'm laying down she tell me sit up, I sit up
She push me down I sit up
She push me down I get up
Then I act like ima hit her
But I'm a better nigga
She can't find a better nigga, nah


I think about you when I'm riding dirty
Said I love you for I left, I hope you heard me
Case I never make it back, I hope you heard me
And if you ever have twins name em bright and early
Cause I'm up for the money I hope you down with it
No this ain't game but I can be found in it
And why be in it if I'm not gon win it
So I be playing til the last minute, you don't get it
See that ground hurt when you hit it, I wouldn't lie baby
But fuck with me and you forever fly baby
So far from the buttom I swear
Smell the work in the air, I'm there
You can never take that from me
And what I been through you can't take back from me
If I offend you then mama get back from me
But if you love then I know you coming back for me, you love my style
