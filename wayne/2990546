26 ContributorsMy Corner Lyrics
Yeah
Let's get real vulgar and loud in here, uh huh

Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, for real
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, for real

Picture me stompin' you out, up on a flyin' train
Ripped Nikes on, hollow through your hollow brain
I suffocate cats, I rape tracks, all of this is late facts
I wished from the stove, it came, yes
Porsche racin' with Scottish pitts
Best fly rum in the world
I got your girl eatin' exotic dick
Anthrax pussy, the minks, whiskey king
Wrote my name on her face, yeah, yeah, kush me
Elevation keep the arm clustery, thousands of guns
We got money too, and we know how to fight someone
But niggas get burned and sodomized
Chopped into a capsule, amass cool, I'm that live
Yeah, shower that nigga down, he pussy
Tryna hang with wolves, yo, you still plain pussy
Don't ever move, we'll detonate
Fuck up your whole plantation in one night to separate
You might also like
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal

One for the money, nothin' after that shit
I'm gettin' foreign money, money talks with an accent
Life is a maze, I done ran out of Pac-Men
Really need a crown on my head like a catholic
Never been a bitch and I don't plan on startin'
Blood gang, beat a beat like Pam on Martin
And you wonder why my right hand man stand-offish
'Cause he got that blam blam on point like swordfish
I'm walkin' 'round the mansion on a cordless
Arguin' with a bitch 'bout how I cannot be her boyfriend
And then I told her, "Hold on, let me click over"
It was my homie T, 'bout to bring them bricks over
We 'bout to break 'em down like when hammers hit boulders
If one of us goes down then we keep our lips frozen
Who that nigga with, Blood? Make that nigga spit blood
Bullet ain't got no name but the nigga that it hit does
Come through in my bitch's car, shoot you with my bitch's gun
She asked where I've been, I just had to make a quick run
I'm an NWA, nigga with an AK
That'll put an end to the melee
Smokin' on pounds 'til them shits just deadweight
Ben Franklin straitjacket, my money gon' stay straight
Lil Tunechi
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal

I seen it all, done it all and still doin' it
Who gave you crime action stories, live from the bricks?
Now it's more diamonds, more bread, more bitches, more head
More land to cover and haters get more lead
Monster rap, decorated, general stripes, I'm top rank
Raise your arm up, salute the globe's most realest still
M16 rounds from 16s
Blood money over here, cash rules daily
Flip train, lay it down flat, call it a G language
Keep flamin', sophisticated killers that's rich and famous
For actin' like your bakery bakes stacks
Get your cake snatched, and your pride too
Money can't replace that
Run but you can't hide
The games that you play'll get you viewed by a coroner, coward
This is my corner
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal4Embed
