This argument is just gonna keep going on, and on
And at this point I don't even really care who's right or wrong, ah
I just don't wanna fight anymore, even forever but on you and for
And if you think this is the way to be, I'm sorry this ain't no worth on me
And I know, I know, that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose, if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go, cause you soon already know that
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter X 3
Don't even matter, what you sayin'
Right now I just need some time so I can do some thinking
Will this be the end of me and you, whoa, whoa
All I know is that I'm stressed out
Seems like we've tried everything I gave me best shot
Now and every time for us to go in the town
I know, that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose, if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go, cause you soon already know that
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go, girl you already know that
You might also likeI'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter X 3
I got that gene in my system, somebody gonna be my victim
Yeah, don't fight that love, just bear with me baby like a white and black cub
Girl love is a must, so don't put up a fuss
I'm hard as steel, she wet, making rust
With you nobody, and I'm somebody
... around it, yeah, haha
All we do is fussin, don't start honey
And I put that ... and make you up funny
Yeah, PJ, young money, New Orleans, and it really don't start nothing
Won't be nothing, let me say something
I'm a lover not a fighter, but I think I told you that
I know, that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose, if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go, cause you soon already know that
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter X 3Embed
