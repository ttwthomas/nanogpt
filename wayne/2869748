Dear Lord, oh Lord, hah
Yup

I'm rebellious and fearless, I laugh at failure
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer
I'm a prophet, a legend, I'm not beggin'
I'd rather die for my freedom than live like a peasant
Depressions, recessions, the past and the present
Slavery to segregation, I still rob with my brethren
See these shackles up up off me, I'm street but I'm Godly
Know these white folks fear me but nothin' can stop me
I was destined to be this so nothin' amaze me
My best attribute is bravery, they think that I'm crazy
Ask Gucci if you with me, then let's get to walkin'
Cause I'm sick and tired of everybody doing nothin' but talkin'

Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my payer
Know you ain't take me this far just to leave me here
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer
Dear Lord, oh Lord, I know that life's unfair
But who gon take care of the family if I'm not there? (Lord)
Dear Lord, oh Lord
You might also like
I gotta feed the family
But I had to leave the family
I cut off CMB, I'm an amputee
But I never leave Christianity
Might have to plead insanity
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
I'mma pray for you niggas, then celebrate
Lord I know these streets contaminate
But Lord I can't get beat like Anna Mae
Lord I gotta think about Reginae
And Lil Tune and Lil Neal and Lil Cameron
Lord, I gotta think like I'm Hemingway
Make a way, well shit anyway, anyway
Lord I gotta create and innovate
Or else it's back to the interstate
Wheeling my fortunes
Willing to kill you just for my fortunes
I can recall we were chillin' on porches
Living with roaches, dealin' with hoe shit
Ceilings to low shit, now we in motion, everything kosher
God bless the 'Nolia, God bless Angola
Rest in Peace Soulja  and all of the soldiers
The war isn't over, call on Jehovah, Lord

Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my payer
Know you ain't take me this far just to leave me here
Dear Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer
Lord, oh Lord, please hear my prayer
Dear Lord, oh Lord, I know that life's unfair
But who gon take care of the family if I'm not there? (Lord)
Dear Lord, oh Lord
Mula baby
Dear Lord, oh Lord
Dear Lord, oh Lord
Dear Lord, oh Lord
I gotta feed the family
