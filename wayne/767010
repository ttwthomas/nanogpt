3 ContributorsNymphos (Remix) Lyrics
Weezy Baby
Now I'm The Type of Nigga That Be Up In Tha Studio Faithfully
She Ain't Trippin She Wait For Me
I Tell Her When I Get A Break I'm A Break Her
Off So Courageously
I Got Dem Bangin Drums
She Got Dem Alicia Keyes
Ooh Girl Let's Make A Beat
Ooh Girl You Make Me Weak Like Every Time The Track Break
Make The Control Room Boom Like An 808
And If You Walk Your Thong Into This Vocal Booth I Can Guarantee I'm A Make This Song All About You
And You Know I Got Da Drank
You Know I Got Da Stank
It's Amazin How I Think But I Do So
And Every Time I Meet A Girl She Tell Me That She Sang And I Say I Gotta House With A Studio
I'm Jus Tryna Do My Thang Baby Video or Audio
Shawty I'm So Smooth I Go Errywhere That Water Go
Ooh So Bad, So Mean
Make Me Wrap Yo Ass UpLike A Hot 16
And I Promise You Ain't Wanna Hear Nobody Else Flow
Welcome To My Studio, You Gon Love My Studo

Now I could make miracles with tempos
It's instrumental
Waitin for the nymphos
That's the intro
Shook when ya rushed me
You walked up and touched me
Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just cause I'm paid in the worst way... True
Lookin kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if your wild or ya act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch when you lick your lips, shake your hips
Goddamn, I love that shit
Now let's stop fake gimme real now
I got a room and a hard on, Still down?
Met ya standin at a bar full of black dudes
Said ya wanna see my scars and my tatooes
When we head for my hideout, act right
You might also likeBoss playa when I ride out, that's right
Oh Shit Baby Is A Dime Piece
More Than Just Fine
She's Personally Blessed From The Gods
If I Seen Her Right Now
She Could Get Me Hard
Didn't Wanna Talk To Me Just To See My Car
Never Had Sex With A Rich Rap Star
Til I Got Her In Theh Back Of My Homeboy's Car
Tell Me Why Do We Live This Way
Money Ova Biches Let Me Hear You Say
What's Yo Phone Number
Are You Alone?
Got A Pocket Full Of Rubbers Let's Bone
Time To Tell Ya Girlfriend To Take You Home
I Had Fun, But Baby Gotta Leave Me Alone
Picture In My Rhyme Take Time To Rewind These Ordinary Words I Say
If You Opening Ya Mouth
Bet In A Minute You'll Find It's Time
Let The Outlaws Play

Ludacris can't hide or deny that I wanna get you down to them Vickie Seeecretsss
And your body I won't misguide mistreat or misleeeeead it
Hate it up, love it, they can't cut it, so strut it
Number one shaker, like Vick's vapor I wanna fuckin ruuuuuub it
Louisville slug it hit em with a right left, it's goooooone
Tell every last one of ya girls how good it was and it's gone be onnnnnn
Soul Train, more brain for meeeee
No pain, no gain, it's so plain to seee
They be like "I've been feelin kind of stressed can you blow my back out? "
And I'm like "Yea but don't trip if I happen to yank a track out"
When I get done it's smooth sailin once I pull that 'Lac out
Next destination I move forward like Jerry Stackhouse
And 1, have fun, when you chillin with Ludi
We'll slow grind to slow jams while I'm feelin yo booty
We'll hold hand and hold times when I'm up in that coochie
You so fine I'm so sad that you feelin so wooooozyEmbed
