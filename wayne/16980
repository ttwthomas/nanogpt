7 ContributorsMillionaire Lyrics
Damn I got platinum on both of my wrists and my pinky
And my album went platinum too
Man you know I'm a stunt' all these other rappers, look (New Cash Money!)

I'm sick of it, niggas illiterate
And I need me seven zeroes or somethin' legitimate
I done shot at niggas, and I been shot at
I done had a whole lotta old folks tellin me stop that
I'm sorry but them Lexus trucks, I gotta cop that
Would be even mo' sweeter, if I could drop that
You see all of them Crystal bottles, I pop that
And I'm bout to go and find me a new mall to shop at

I'm out the heart of the hood
Niggas like to bust heads and look good
Ride on 20's with TV's leather interior and wood
Rolexes, at least ten G's on a necklace
Pullin up at the club in two Caddy truck stretches
My click boss nigga, try to follow us get lost, nigga
We'll buy a whole block no matter the cost, nigga
My money long, my dick long, I'm off the chain
B.G. got it goin' on respect the game
You might also like
Me and my dogs we ball, just like we live we love
Get in our path of money and your head get bust
Me and my dogs we ball, just like we live we love
Get in our path of money and your head get bust

Nigga I live like an old man, but I'ma young man
With bout three million dollars worth of cars in my name
Went to East over, brought the whole block man
Got these white folks fucked up by the mouth man
E'ry type 2000, me and Juvie got 'em
V8 350 Camaro, Fresh got 'em
Bought a million dollar Rolex, a nigga doubtin'
Cartier watch for three-hundred and fifty thousand
A hundered-thousand dollar grill and a nigga smilin'
Matchin' platinum ink pens for four thousand
Bought a hundred-thousand Benz and I'm buck-wild with it
Changin everything from the in and the out in it

How you figure you the nigga, to shut it down?
What you mad convertible Jag cause I let it down?
You know who I am, God damn
You ain't skinniess on yo' 20's; then look here nigga scram
Now what in the wide wide world of ballin is that?
Some shit that come out in 2010, you lil' chrome stuck bitch
Who made that car? I never seen that on the streets
We were in the Vibe magazine, Baby got thirty-two gold teeth
Me and my dogs we ball, just like we live we love
Get in our path of money and your head get bust
Me and my dogs we ball, just like we live we love
Get in our path of money and your head get bust (Look, look, look, look)

I'ma stun'na, reppa, ride around in different hummers
With a dozen heffers, fifty-thousand dollar Roley
With a crusted bezel, niggas can't compete with us
We on another, level, watch us skrrt off in the Viper
With the windows tinted, automatic start with VCR's
And TV's in it, I always go out my pocket
Never penny pinchin, that's why I'm dippin my Expedition
With plenty women, and they wit it, wit it
Not to mention 'bout my Ninja, with the extension
What about my condominium wit yo wife in the kitchen
See I gets lots of attention I'm the youngest, Tymer
Plus I step into the light wit them humongous, diamonds
See everybody know I'm Lil Wayne soldier
Pull up in the 4.6 Range Rover
Baby had me drinkin' think I got a hangover
Weezy Wheez' nigga, Hot Boys, game over

Me and my dogs we ball, just like we live we love
Get in our path of money and your head get bust
Me and my dogs we ball, just like we live we love
Get in our path of money and your head get bust
Me and my dogs we ball, just like we live we love
Get in our path of money and your head get bust
Me and my dogs we ball, just like we live we love
Get in our path of money and your head get bust
Nigga, it's Cash Money Millionaires
Fuck with us nigga, your head get bust
We step in the light, and it and it just be
Bling bling, bling, bling bling
What? My nigga B. Geezy
What? My nigga, Beatrice
Huh, my nigga Mannie Fresh, what?
My nigga Lil Weezy, alright then, uh-huh
My nigga Ju-vey, that motherfuckin Hot Boy
Nigga, Cash Money takin over this bitch
And we ain't lettin' go yet..
