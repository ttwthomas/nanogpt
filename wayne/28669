11 ContributorsWe Come and See About It Lyrics
Yeah, yea, OK

Came in the game as a young'n
Signed with Cash Money
Pocket full of money
Niggas poppin shit
Always talkin bout somethin
See ya ass in public
It's a whole 'nother subject
Man, they just talkin bout it
They just talkin bout it
And I'm on the streets with it
I'm on the streets with it
See where I come from
You gotta be about it
And if you want it-want it
We come and see about it
OK

Uhh, it's Weezy Baby like the last shit
A big car and a bad bitch
Uhh, I'm so fly I need my ass kicked
These niggas ballin by accident
Uhh, keep talkin, nigga fuck up ya body
Send ya home and tell ya mom it was an accident
Uhh, I'm a G til the casket
Drop on my glasses
Uhh, fast money, I'm the fastest
I got that hustler's passion
Ya know
Them boys back at the ass-end
I'm at the bank, tryna cash in
OK

Yeah, there's been a murder
Bitch I make a killing
Insurance papers in the safe
Money in the ceiling
Uhh, I got a pillow case full of pistols
Come through a nigga house and aim at the pillows
Uhh, yeah — Wake up, wake up
Fuckin with them boys, you can wake up taped up
Ya dig?
Now go on, drink that lake up
Stick 'em in the trunk
And let 'em feel that bass pump
These niggas is nuts
Man, that M14 leave you physically fucked
These niggas is ducks
Well you can call me Scrooge
Cause I'm swimming in bucks

All my guns black, I got true soul

And I call my coupe a Black Panther
Blat, blat, blat
That's the gat anthem
And if a nigga play with family, for that matter
I'mma smoke so many niggas I'mma catch cancer
Yeah
And if I step up out this Benzo
You know I'm coming with a gun, like a Nintendo
They soft
Them niggas falling when the wind blow
And I'm rollin up my window
Fuck 'em
Came in the game as a young'n

See from where I come from
You gotta be about it
And if you want it-want it
