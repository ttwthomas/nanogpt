14 ContributorsDo It Lyrics
Uh, mm
(Marley Waters)
Yeah

This may be wrong
I'm well aware, I'm turning you on
Even though I'm not trying
Nigga, you know I'm lying

'Cause I got these heels on, this dress on
You can take 'em off, way too throwed
This right here, shit, too grown
Like that, that, that, that

See, I'mma tell you like this
Baby, I don't usually do this (No)
Usually a virtuous woman
Now we don't even know what we doing
But I'mma go ahead and do it
Do it, do it, just have fun
Do it, do it, just go dumb
You might also like
Used to be afraid of them boys like you
That's because I know what type of things you do (Done)
Know it's hard out here for a G like you
Crazy as it sounds, that's why I like you

See I got these heels on, this dress on
You can take them off, way too throwed
This right here, shit too grown
Like that, that, that, that

See I'mma tell you like this
Baby, I don't usually do this (No)
Usually a virtuous woman
Now we don't even know what we doing
But I'mma go ahead and do it
Do it, do it, just have fun
Do it, do it, just go dumb

The bridge
Nights like this I wish
On a night like this I wish sometimes, sometimes
Nights like this I wish
I wish, Tunechi
Mula, baby
Now Lord, I don't know what she doing
But I know she know what she be doing
So with that said, I'mma keep doing
Just what the fuck I be doing
I'm grown, I'm in that pussy like "honey I'm home"
You need a rockstar, and baby, I'm stoned
We going up like the fucking Dow Jones
She said she ain't had no good dick lately
Well it's your luck today, treat me like Vegas
She say she don't usually do this, she a lady
And then we made love, nigga, we made it
She got them sweet soft lips, she lick 'em
Her kisses get returned to sender
She got that liquor in her system
And I'm about to be her victim, yeah

See I got these heels on, this dress on
You can take them off, way too throwed
This right here, shit too grown (Tunechi)
Like that, that, that, that

See, I'mma tell you like this
Baby, I don't usually do this (Alright)
Usually a virtuous woman
Now we don't even know what we doing (I know)
But I'mma go ahead and do it
Do it, do it (Do it to me)
Just have fun
Do it, do it (Do it to me)
Just go dumb
Nights like this I wish
She got that liquor in her system
Somebody  'bout to be her victim
Do it to me
Tunheci, Mula, baby2Embed
