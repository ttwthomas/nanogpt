24 ContributorsMain Things Lyrics
You see?
The goal is just to raise the babies right
Wayne babies, that is
You guys are maturing so much!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's crazy how you look like your dad
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tunechi, I must say, job well done
Yeah
And I just told my main thing "Since you my main thing
You can turn yo' phone off and let your name ring"
6 shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah I just told my main thing "Since you my main thing"
DJ Drama
Bitch I won the race

All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night we can't recall it
Every day she catchin' feelings, every night I throw a party
She done died and went to heaven, I forgot to close the coffin
I'm just lookin' for lil sexy to direct me from the horror
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promisin' she loyal
So I promise to be faithful
Yeah, Lil Weezy; "F" for "Faithful, Funky, Freaky, Freshly Flavored
Flawless, Fleek, Finesse, Finagle"
You might also like
I just tell my main ting "Since you my main ting
You can turn your phone off and let your name ring
We can take them clothes off and let that thang breathe
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean"

I just poured a whole deuce inside a 16
Cried my whole heart out, she cried with me
She like to put the top down and tell me "Let 'em see"
She like to leave the doors up, they look like referees
She like to throw it back until she got back pains
She got her own little special contact name
She take it in the ass, ain't worryin' 'bout the crack game
Me, her, plus another bitch, she don't care if the math change
Yeah, I just poured a whole deuce inside a 16
Got her reppin' suwoo, she reppin' big Bs
And she ain't worryin' 'bout fuckin' on a private plane
And she don't do the phone thing, she do the finer things
It's all about deserving things and not designer things
She all about her certain ring and not all kind of rings
All about the sure things and not the shiny things
Man, she so tired of swervin' niggas, need a tire change

All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night we can't recall it
She lay down and close her eyes, fall asleep open hearted
She done died and went to heaven, I forgot to close the coffin
I'm just lookin' for lil' sexy to direct me from the sorrow
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promise to be loyal
So I promise to be faithful, but I'm prolly not gon' chase you
Sit down on my dinner table, eat that pussy like it's catered
I just tell my main ting "Since you my main ting
You can turn your phone off and let your name ring
You can scratch yo' goals off and you can thank me
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean"
I just told my main thing "Since you my main thing
Let them have the fame thing 'cause it's the same thing
You can take them clothes off and let that thang breathe
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean"

I just poured a whole deuce inside a 16
Yeah she reppin' two countries, yeah she mixed breed
Got her smokin' rapper weed, tryna spit Vs
She been goin' 30 minutes, she just switched knees
Uh, pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary
Pimpin' ain't dead, check the cemetery
If I tell you that I love you, I ain't lying girl
So worry 'bout yourself and not the other bitch I'm tellin'

All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night was all recorded
Every day she catchin' feelings, every night I throw a party
That's that "Fire and Desire", I forgot to throw her water
I'm just lookin' for lil' sexy to direct me from the horror
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promise that she loyal
So I promise to be faithful
Yeah, Lil Weezy; F for faithful, funky, freaky, freshly flavored
Flawless, fleek, finesse, finagle and fatal2Embed
