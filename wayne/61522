Yeah, yup, yeah

She's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder, for me, for me, for me, for me
Now I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what you've been told (You've been told)
But all I know, but all I know, all I know, all I know is that you been warned
About my girl, she's a killa, she's a killa, she's bad, she's bad, oh God, oh my (Oh my)
She's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder
And she rydin' for me, she rydin' for me, she rydin' for me, she rydin' for me
She's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder, she's a ryder
And she rydin' for me, she rydin' for me

Uh, yeah she a ryder like a lady in a wheelchair
Louis V purse on her arm, she keep the steel there
She gon' hold me down if the feds come and get me
And I'mma make her fuck the judge for a lighter sentence, uh
Yeah, the devil wears Prada bitch, and she rydin' for me, you don't want no problems bitch
She about it, bitch, and she keep it real
And she owns two twin pumps like a pair of heels
No Nicole Richie, no Paris Hil', just my gangsta
Boy she'll spin you like a Ferris wheel
Takin' money and she bring it home to me, nigga
Yeah she's a ryder and she rydin' for me nigga

And she rydin' for me, she rydin' for me (For me)
Now I don't know, now I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what you've been told (What you've been told)

Oh, but I know, that you've been warned
About my girl, about my girl, about my girl, about my girl, about my girl, about my girl
She's a ryder, she's a ryder
And she rydin' with me (She rydin' with me), she rydin' with me (She rydin' with me)
