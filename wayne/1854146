Don't fucking do one fucking song on a motherfucking album, get one motherfucking check, and go fucking crazy, and then get dropped from the motherfucking label, and now you got your motherfucking fans like
"What happenend to you? When you comin out?"
Ahh! ahhh!

"Are you coming out with Wayne?"
"Nah I got my own record label"

I don't care if a nigga gave it to you navigation, don't go there. Understand?
Rule number 2: Don't fuck with nobody's girl
And rule number 3...: Nobody has a girl
