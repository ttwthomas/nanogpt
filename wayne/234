42 ContributorsNo Ceilings (Pop That) Lyrics
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
I say pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
You gotta pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that
No ceilings, no ceilings, no ceilings

Okay: pockets on He-Man, I get it if I demand
Man, I do it big, to me you niggas wee, man
'Bout to go Pecans, I beat it like three hands
Weezy in the building, you other niggas freelance
I dont give a fizzuck, I done got my shit up
I gotta do a bid; that's push-ups, sit-ups
Fuck with Young Money, bitch nigga get hit up
N-Nigga, "fuck" can't even fuck with us
I'm a Eastside nigga, yeah, Eastside, nigga
Where the muthafucking beef gets deep-fried, nigga
Nigga couldn't see me with three eyes, nigga
You’s a bitch: no U-N-I-T-Y, nigga
On the mic I’m like Pac, I'm like B-I, nigga
Whoever don’t agree come and see my nigga
I'll be waiting in my mansion, seaside nigga
Young muthafucking M-O-N-E-Y, nigga
You might also like
Hurt no, hurt no
I dont wanna hurt no, hurt no
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
I dont wanna hurt nobody tonight
I dont wanna hurt nobody tonight
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
Everyday pushing me, pushing me

Pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
I say pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
You gotta pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that
No ceilings

Okay: Cool & Dre, this is No Ceilings
I do this all day; I got bars, no railings
Looking for a bitch for some sexual healing
Open up her mouth and she catch it like Braylon
Young Weezy F, the 'F' is not for failing
Swagger just dumb, call it Sarah Palin
If you niggas fly, then I must be parasailing
We-We are not the same, I'm a mutherfucking alien
Back on my saddle with my tool in my hand
Uptown real nigga, bitch, landed in the sand
Back home, nigga, did it for the land
For the grand with the money with the tool in my hand
High life, give a fuck about your stripes, homie
Killer kill, killer spend your bin daily, homie
Turn left get your switch turned off, nigga
Turn right and get your shit took off, nigga
Fuck Grey Goose, cause we higher than we ever been
More loaded, white doves, burning hundreds
Overseas nigga pitching on the top floor
High floor situation from the bottom floor
Born in the middle, shining like a diamond
Red diamonds, big diamonds how we roll, nigga
On 24s, fucking all these hoes, nigga
High life: getting money then we go, nigga

Hurt no, hurt no
I dont wanna hurt no, hurt no
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
I dont wanna hurt nobody tonight
I dont wanna hurt nobody tonight
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
Everyday pushing me, pushing me3Embed
