2 ContributorsLittle Wayne Lyrics
Sipping lean riding on the Bay Bridge back to Berkley
Promethazine got me nodding out
Thinking bout tonight I get to see my baby
But first I got to pick some things up from the town

I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Bobby, that Whitney
I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Lindsay Lohan, that Kirk Cobain
I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Mac Dre, that Yao Ming
I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Bob Marley, that Lil Wayne

Things get  with me, I ain't helping nobody get clean
Skinny Joe want some blow, rest of  wants a 
Well I know it ain't right, but I know it'll weigh out on a triple beam
Rest in  ghetto my friend, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta

I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Bobby, that Whitney
I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Lindsay Lohan, that Kirk Cobain
I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Mac Dre, that Yao Ming
I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Bob Marley, that Lil Wayne

Money to be made best believe a nigga glocking
I run it myself, like a quarterback option
I pitch her 10 G's, tell the bitch to go shopping
She buy herself some clothes and she brought me back a chopper
See niggas wanna kick it, but no, I don't play soccer
I'm all about my cake, I'm tryna marry Betty Crocker
My package on the way, you know my whip game proper
And off of one key I see 70,000 dollars (hit me)

I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Bobby, that Whitney
I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Lindsay Lohan, that Kirk Cobain
I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Mac Dre, that Yao Ming
I gotta rica, rica, rica
I need that Bob Marley, that Lil Wayne

I gotta rica, rica, rica
I gotta rica, rica, rica
I gotta rica, rica, ricaEmbed
