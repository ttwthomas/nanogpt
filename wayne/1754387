5 ContributorsLyrical Homicide LyricsPublic Enemy number 2, the flow is illegal
And these ain't diesel, all fucking Evisu
These is Levi's, equipped with the desert eagle
Run, tell your people, that nigga get evil
Throw em off the bridge like Knievel
You niggas see-through
Like lingerie pussies I get funky like D.O.C. do
One classic, now homie, OG too
I toast a chronic blunt everytime I see Snoop
Aston Martin Driver, gave away the B(entley) Coupe
Cried for three days, after that I had to re-group
Bullet-proof suburban, nigga fuck with that
Shoot the tires out, drive 60 miles on a flat
Flip the motherfucker over watch it slide on its back
Let the windows up as bullets fly out the Mac
No gunpowder on me, I'm as fly as the Mac
Lyrical homicide, watch them die on the track. (nigga)
Lyrical homicide
Kill them and watch them die, yeah
(The Game)
Because you ain't never seen a motherfucker
Kill a motherfucker
Like a motherfucker nigga named Game, motherfucker

Kill them and watch them die, yeah
(The Game)
Because you ain't never seen a motherfucker
Kill a motherfucker
Like a motherfucker nigga named Game, motherfucker
Yeah, I'ma murder this shit
Tell Dr. Dre the beat need surgery quick
Weezy from the dirty south, yeah, the dirtiest bitch
But I'm clean like a virgin and detergent and shit, (ha)
I walked into the record store drooling
Because it's like a supermarket to me
Yeah, and as my appetite gets bigger
I see you new rappers and you look like dinner
Lyrical killer
I kill at will
And my flow keeps going when the beat stand still
How real is that? Nigga that's for real
Fuck with me and you're pushing up daffodils
So don't you get this rap twisted
Fuck around and get your cap twisted
Stop it right there, rewind it back and listen
And you have just become another victim
Lyrical homicide
Kill them and watch them die, yeah
(The Game)
Because you ain't never seen a motherfucker
Kill a motherfucker
Like a motherfucker nigga named game, motherfucker
Lyrical homicide
Kill them and watch them die, yeah
(The Game)
Because you ain't never seen a motherfucker
Kill a motherfucker
Like a motherfucker nigga named game, motherfuckerEmbed
