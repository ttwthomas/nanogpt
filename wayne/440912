3 ContributorsSide Bitch Lyrics
Havin' too much fun
Like, too much fun together to just
Ya know?
Everybody gotta have a little fun on the side
Everybody gotta have a little fun on the side

I can't wait until she my bitch
Cause right now I'm just her side bitch
She got a nigga she can ride with
But got the nerve to put me in although that's my dick
Damn...
Lord I'm so tired of being her side bitchYou might also like3Embed
