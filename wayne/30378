1 ContributorWe Fresh LyricsYeah Yeah woo
(Verse 1)
Call me Mannie the great fresh is how I stay
New Orleans the city 7th ward the place
Got a gang of money and a bunch of women
They rubbing on my belly cause I'm country pimp
Now every time I drive its hella bright inside
That's that hi-defintion tv light inside
And every time I ride nina under the seat
I don't want no trouble and trouble don't want me
I can walk the streets with my adidas on
Just a chubby ass nigga wife beater on
Pimp the gangsta kangol lean it to the right
And your girl like an addict cause she really want the pipe
And I like to drink she prefer to puck
And she like to have sex I prefer to fuck
And I'm a tell you once I ain't gone tell you again
I'm just lookin for some pussy that I can fall in cause
(Chorus: Lil Wayne)
Dude fell off, Then you fell off, Then he fell off, and then the weak fell off
But Wayne's well off and Mannie's well off and the Family's well off
Ay we Cash Money
We stay fre fresh err Fresh
Every day we fre fresh err Fresh
In every way we fre fresh err Fresh
We so heavy we fresh we so err Fresh

I'm in that new SS with the chrome pipes
Or the Hauly truck you know towing the bikes
And dont stare at me wrong if you know I'm right
I'm like fuck a player hater and your ho I might
Wanna take me to war I call G.I. Joe
While G.I. Jane still giving me brain
I dont ever complain I'm to cool for that
Got the Polo Sport Edition wth the shoes to match
I got the blue to black got the white, the red
Got the parachute pants with the pockets big
I dont half step, I dont half ass
I want half check and half cash
When it comes to the tracks I'm a bad man
So if the rap dont sell I still got my hands
Got your girl in the club tyring to do my dance
While I whisper in her ear could you do my mans when
(Chorus: Lil Wayne)
Dude fell off, Then you fell off, Then he fell off, and then the weak fell off
But Wayne's well off and Mannie's well off and the Family's well off
Ay we Cash Money
We stay fre fresh err Fresh
Every day we fre fresh err Fresh
In every way we fre fresh err Fresh
We so heavy we fresh we so err Fresh
(Verse 3)
I represent the S like I've been doing so long
Now every hood in America know all my songs
Call me super producer a loveable lovely
I call her when you gone cause I like how she rub me
I shoot straight over play times over
Cobra all in your waistline told ya
Keep it gangsta, keep it real
Sittin low in a coupe yeah coupe deville
I'm a baller baby that baby ballin
I dont mean to brag but I'm straight regardless
All white chevy gravy guts
With the stashbox pimpin yeah custom deluxe
Shorty let your hair out convertible air out
I got the same wheel in my 5th wheel spare mount
Mannie Fresh my truck expands
And I'm a downtown nigga with my nuts in my hand cause
(Chorus:lil' Wayne)
Dude fell off, Then you fell off, Then he fell off, and then the weak fell off
But Wayne's well off and Mannie's well off and the Family's well off
Ay we Cash Money
We stay fre fresh err Fresh
Every day we fre fresh err Fresh
In every way we fre fresh err Fresh
We so heavy we fresh we so err FreshEmbed
