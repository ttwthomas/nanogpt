Yeah, uh-huh
Come on, yep
Mmmhmm, bells
Yeah, hmhmhmm
Let's go

Riding 'round the city
With some brand new heat
Brand new car
Brand new feet
Brand new seats
Brand new smell
Put out the roach
Light a brand new L
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new
Fuck you bitch
My shirt brand new
Fuck you bitch
My shoes brand new
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new
Yeah
You might also like
I'm cold like a midnight
In Aspen
I am the President
And the assassin
Cameras on
Big lights, "Action"
Welcome to the show
I am the main attraction
Money in the mattress
Money in the attic
Money on my mind
Money is my habit
Stay on the grind
Until money's automatic
Bitch, I love money
I'm a fucking fanatic
Always strapped, gripped-tight, graspin'
Say what? Who, me? (Click-clack) Blast 'em
Chrome 24's, tires thin like napkins
Got to ride big 'cause I am like a captain
You know I'm a boss; chillin', relaxin'
Probably in my office, doing my taxes
You little niggas so not in my bracket
And I don't even have time to practice
Riding 'round the city
With some brand new heat
Brand new car
Brand new feet
Brand new seats
Brand new smell
Put out the roach
Light a brand new L
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch
My shirt brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch
My shoes brand new (them too)
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new (yeah)

Ice
Ridiculous price
Your camera has never saw a picture this nice
Hm, I'm fishin', and the bitches will bite
It's probably 'cause my game is Fixodent tight
Right
I'm fucking every bad bitch twice
And if she doesn't wear panties then I fuck her on sight
I'm nasty like spice
I know what she likes
I can make a black woman
Scream like she white
I can make a white woman
Scream like Mike
But before she starts singin'
She got to check my mic
Niggas just hatin'
And I done lost sight
It's like I don't see 'em
I only see the light
Talking that shit
But you boys just hype
I hope you bring a gun to the fight
A'ight?
Louis V tennis shoes
Big brown stripe
You think you fresh?
Shit, nigga – I'm ripe
Riding 'round the city
With some brand new heat
Brand new car
Brand new feet
Brand new seats
Brand new smell
Put out the roach
Light a brand new L
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch
My shirt brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch
My shoes brand new (them too)
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new (yeah)

OK
Brand new coupe
Driving crazy than a mother
Sittin' low in the seats
With the burner sittin' under
Got my tank top, top down
It probably ain't summer
But I ride like that 'cause I'm hotter than the others
Damn, there's no keeping up with the brother man
I could spell my name in burnt rubber
I'm gone!  Leave me alone
Now the dog is at supper
You could wash my plate and put it back in the cupboard
Ahem, I'm so far ahead of them suckers
I'mma have to start rappin' in numbers
I promise, the flows don't stop
They come rapid like thunder
I bet you hide under your covers

Riding 'round the city
With some brand new heat
Brand new car
Brand new feet
Brand new seats
Brand new smell
Put out the roach
Light a brand new L
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch
My shirt brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch
My shoes brand new (them too)
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new (yeah)47Embed
