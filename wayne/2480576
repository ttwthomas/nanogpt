Yeah, part 2
Ooh, ooh
This right here is O.T
Allah bought a OZ
Deej right here my homies
This right here my OGs

Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it

Them prices is way too high, you need to cut it
My niggas way too high, them niggas muddy, Lord
My niggas way too wild, them niggas nutty
That Cash Money check is way behind, they need to cut it
$2205 off a 17-5
Money on the bed, I'ma need a king size
Got that cocaine blizzard, we like Dairy Queen slime
And we got prescriptions if you tryna prescribe
Man these out of town niggas with these out of town prices
Not around here nigga, chop it down, slice it
Oh Lord, these niggas tax it, that's okay, just jack me
Give it to my lil' nigga, just bring me back a fraction
You need to cut it
You might also like
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it

Why your eye cold
Like dealing from the bottom, foreign objects and your dice rolled
Don't you know that shit get your head cracked?
Don't you know that shit get your life stole?
You done fucked up, in the wrong hood
Tryna ride rims over potholes
And boy you know we don't be going for
All that charging too much for a O' and stuff
Mediocre work, and now he going up
Tell em gone on, lose your phone number
You done fucked up, and got the wrong one
I take your homegirl and put her on some
You a couple $100 more short on grammar
So you keep on playing, that we got hammers for
Shoot out your window, there go your antidote
Along with all of your homies
Boy you really know we with the shit
If you got something we want, we come get the shit
Now you walking around acting like we friends and shit
Knowing damn well we did the shit
See you playing with it, got your hands in it
Found your stash spot, nigga ran in it
With the straps out, we demanding it
Money right now, or it's lights out
I don't know why you be playing
Boy don't you know as much as this cost
See I don't think you understand
It costs me less than that to get you knocked off
Better cut your shit down, don't know where they kept it
Boy I bullshit you not
Hit somebody up right now, I can call with a way better deal
That's why I ain't finna buy, boy the shit too high
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it1Embed
