85 ContributorsGreen Ranger Lyrics
You know I've been talkin shit for a generation now
'Bout that time for me to kick my feet up
Y'know? Move on to other endeavors
Who's ready to take the torch?
Somebody? Anybody?
Haven't I taught you everything?

When this shit dropped, I was like 16
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing, big dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans, nigga got a job
Had my little wad, worst fear was getting robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
Five dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
Minimum wage, $5.15
13s on the whip, kept my shit clean, uh
Actually that was my mama shit
But I’m drivin' 'round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah, I’m headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game but I got a lot of lip
That's why them niggas don’t like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely
Uh, I know the game, I’m an expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I'm gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone
And I ain't fuck yet 'cause her mama always home
God damn, L-Lord have mercy
Please God, don’t let this little broad have herpes
My nigga say she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets, got her singing falsetto
Tall white tee’s, can’t believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we’re weirdos
But we was only kiddos
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of Skittle
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle
Tryna get to Diddy cause I murder instrumentals
This that good old fashioned Mark Jackson
Fucked then I’ll pass, y’all Utah Jazz-in'
Ya borin’, I don’t play nigga, I’m Mark Madsen
That's why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian
I’m not askin', my nigga I don’t need favors
I’m in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger
My team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger
I fucking ran outta breath, heh
Team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't even like this beat but fuck it
I'ma only spit a few bars 'cause I don't like this beat, let's go

Uh, bitch I’m not old news, I’m more like gold shoes
She eat my whole dick, she like Whole Foods
They say I’m old school, but I dropped out
Drop ya body off, at a cop's house
They throwin' up them bricks, you better box out
My niggas got enough white to build Barack house
I got my drawers on, Sam Rothstein
.44 on my waist, Rick Ross jeans
I’ve been faded, stone wash jeans
New pussy, new money, New Orleans
50 up in that uzi, G-G-G-G-Unit
I murk you with that bitch, scratch the serial number, re-use it, uh
I’m from the N-O, stretch niggas out like limo’s
Uzi go zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit, that's pimples, uh
I’m bout to go banana puddin’, hehe
You a dyke 'cause your man a pussy
Hit you from the blindside, no Sandra Bullock
Never bite the hand that feeds you
Always watch the hand that’s cookin'
Tunechi
Hahaha, yeah man, D4 ho
Shout out Cole, you already know what it is
Cole World, Wayne’s World
We in this bitch ho
Special delivery at your front door
Hahahahahahaha, redbone biatch!11Embed
