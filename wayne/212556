They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
Twenties, tens, and fives; twenties, tens, and fives
If you a balla than a hundred's gon' fly
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, stacks to the sky
We want twenties, tens, and fives, we want twenties, tens, and fives

I'm not a five dollar nigga, I'm a billion dollar entity
All I chase is money only bad bitches interest me
Dade County nigga, diamonds come from Tiffany's
Parked the prototype, it'll hit the streets eventually
Toss my dollar bills, toss my dollar bills
All I ever wanna do, toss my dollar bills
All the talkin' cease, you could hear the breeze
When the bitches realizin' that I'm throwin' hundred b's

They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
Twenties, tens, and fives; twenties, tens, and fives
If you a balla than a hundred's gon' fly
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, stacks to the sky
We want twenties, tens, and fives, we want twenties, tens, and fives
You might also like
Twenties, fifties, hundredes on my bed, I sleep on paper
Pillows made of thousand dollar bills, can you rate the
Million dollar carpet, then I fuck it, keep the change
I keep a lenin closet with some fresh sheets said what's his name?
I got Mr. Woodrow Wilsons hit the stock exchange
And they know what I want, they sit the money for I came
Spend it on the chain blow it all at the bar
Weezy baby comin' through and yes it's Trina rockstar

They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
Twenties, tens, and fives; twenties, tens, and fives
If you a balla than a hundred's gon' fly
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, stacks to the sky
We want twenties, tens, and fives, we want twenties, tens, and fives

Man all I got is hundreds, I ain't even stuntin'
Stuck on the Benjis like Benjamin Button
Trina what it do, I ain't seen ya in a minute
When I think about my life I thank God that you was in it
Call me Weezy Bay-bay, aka Payday
Twenties, tens, fives, I give that shit to Nay-Nay
Young Money boss, Cash Money G
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for free (me)
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
They know what we want-want, give it to us, give it to us
Twenties, tens, and fives; twenties, tens, and fives
If you a balla than a hundred's gon' fly
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, stacks to the sky
We want twenties, tens, and fives, we want twenties, tens, and fives1Embed
