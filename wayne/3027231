Mm, yo

I just started my sentence like a capital letter
Got bars for years, I hope you send me a letter
Know she'll never be queen, so now she got a vendetta
I ain't talkin' 'bout David when I say I'ma get her
Twenty mil' on my off season of course
Twenty million when you ain't put out no album or tours
Yes, bitch, I'm me, pretty and icy
Get it? Icy, but my name's spelled N-I-C, uh

I feel like we goin' under
Take me down, I can't help but wonder
You got everything I want and
If you keep on talkin', I'ma put it where you want it
Keep up, ain't no need to slow it down
We could get it poppin', you could love me, love me downtown
You got everything I want now
Let me fill your fantasies and give you what you dream 'bout

You got somethin' that I believe
I've been waitin' for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me
Light my body up
See David Guetta LiveGet tickets as low as $70You might also like
Light my body up
Light my body up

Stakes are higher than a mother
What you wanna bet that you'll never find another?
Like me, I'm once in a lifetime
Only get all of me once in your lifetime
I'll leave you drownin' in your wet dream
Swimmin' in that love, surf it up in your wet dream
Baby, let me blow your cover
Come on, make me wish I was your part time lover

You got somethin' that I believe
I've been waitin' for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me
Light my body up

Light my body up
Light my body up
Girl, you know I brought that thing right up out the darkness
Made that thing a starfish, right up on my swordfish
I'ma bring sparks and your favorite narcs
Ooh, you raise the bar, you take it far, you rated R
But keep it tight-tight, take this D, go night-night
Go so far downtown on you, I lose Wi-Fi, give me high five
'Cause you know you gon' need a goon to come lick, lick your wounds
Got you lit like tick-tick-tick, like tick-tick-tick
Tick-tick, Tune

You got somethin' that I believe
I've been waitin' for all my (Mula)
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me
