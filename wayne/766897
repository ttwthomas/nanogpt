Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from us
Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from us (no)

Now go down girl, give head, go down, go down girl, give head, go down
Now go down, girl, give head, go down, go down girl give head

Now, momma's a hoe met her at a video with her face ready to go waiting for cameo
She say, I can tell you hustle, i can smell the coke
The money, you got a lot, i can smell the dough
I told her, keep her nose outta business of grown folks
She been to New Orleans twice never been through the Grove
Now her pocketbook nice, and her dress coal
But her teeth pearly white and her lips was swole
She bad, have you seen her?
My n*gga said I might aswell marry a diva, like Trina, I pleased her, she please me the same, hey
What's the beauty without the brain?

Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head

Right on the club, right in the club, shorty popped an x and gave me head right in the club
To be honest, I don't think we gonna go to my truck cause her cousin's with her and she looking better than her
Yeah, she's fat in the ass, slim in the waist, kinda pretty and she down to take the shit in the face
Licking all on her lips, cause she love how I taste
It's dripping on her chin, hope it don't fall on my Bathing Apes
Yeah, I'm glad I found ya, can't wait to bring Wayne and Mack Maine around ya
Gave me head in the pool and I damn near drowned her
Before I'd kiss that hoe, I'd rather kiss a piranha

Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head
Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from us
Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from us

Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head

All my little divas, pay attention, just listen
If we ain't in Paris, then we ain't French kissin'
I'm tryna feel your tongue, I'm just tryna be the one
Give it to ya from the back and make you cough up a lung
Or give a little brain and cough up a sun
I bust two times and then I toss up a one
Now shake it baby, it took your momma 9 months to make you baby
Enter the bedroom, we won't make a baby
Get your knee pads on, no skating baby
So get your aprons baby
She said, I think it's a boy, she ate the baby

Now go down girl, give head, go down go down girl, give head, go down Now go down, girl, give head

Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from us
Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from usEmbed
