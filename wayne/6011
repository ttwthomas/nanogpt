I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (yeah)
If I ever disappear (look), best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again (yeah)
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

I tell her, I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who is he?"
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better than your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully live to see what they say that I'm gon' be
And if not then I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet than to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane, pick a lane, that's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve, without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah, the Chris Paul of this fall
Sittin' this tall, I float high, goodbye, I will miss y'all
See Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear (yeah), best believe I'm comin' back
Stunt hard (I'm leanin')
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

If I don't do nothin', I'mma stunt my ass off
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil
You can't get on my level cause I am so unleveled
I'm a young rebel and I got a babyface
I need a young Pebbles, I need a stunt double
Yeah, me, Drake and Kidd and you know it's trouble
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles
Yeah, I stick my landin' in a freak drawers
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes
Yeah, but I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O, yeah
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious
Yeah, I'm on the cup of that tilt
And if you hatin' on me I'll say fuck you like wilt
Yeah! I'm a wilderbeast. You're just a wildebeest
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace
Yeah! Talkin big big shit
I am rude, I take food from a kid picnic nigga
Yeah and we can bang like bumper cars
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars, haha
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (haan)
If I ever disappear ('bout time)
Best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard (they'll know)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (yeah, okay)
All I ever do is stunt hard

I stunt hard, I stunt harder
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans
I ball hard, So I'm a ball hogger
And I go hard in my dunk like Vince Carter
I hustle harder, I live in the Carter
I think forward, all I see is tomorrow
I need meat I'll turn your shop into a horror
So if you tryin' to see more, better feed me
I'm back on my grizzy like "Izzy" after "gr"
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur
And the feds will never get me like a backwards password
Black spur, ghost I'm like Pacman, Casper
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister
Ask her, am I her man? Her answer is yessir
Shit, I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA 'bout a quarter a day
Now tell them bitches
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear, best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again, all I ever do is stunt hard1Embed
