37 ContributorsWayne on Me Lyrics
I'm calling you daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy, daddy?
I need a daddy, daddy
Would you be my daddy, daddy? (No ceilings)
Come and make it Wayne down on me

Wide receiver Weezy, throw the pussy at me
The pussy lips smiling, I make the pussy happy
Take them panties off, the pussy lookin' at me
I'm the pussy monster, now get the pussy ready
I like to kiss. She like to kiss
I deep stroke and make her bite her fist
The lights is on, the night is grown
We get it poppin' cause we know we can't when wifey home
California kush - strong as a Titan - is what I'm lightin' on
We get high as fuck then we "Just Do It" put your Nikes on
Tattoos on her waist, she like the tattoos on my face
And if there's something she'd like to say
I let her say it on my microphone
She love my style...but that's expected
She coming back to you? The chances anorexic
I knew she had it in her, so I got it out her
She give me neck around the clock: I call it "round the Carter"
She rub my back, she say I'm tight
She cook, fuck and clean
And still make her flight!
First-class pussy, crystal glass pussy
I get it wetter than bass pussy
You might also like
I likes it thick and red
Ralph Lauren spread
Lady in the streets, porn star in bed
She like to fuckfight, so we spar in bed
She got that pink pussy, I beat it orange/red
I fuck American pie and I get foreign head
She sit down and ride like I'm a thoroughbred
She kiss mine, and I kiss hers back
If she's a bad bitch
She deserve that
She send me pictures to my iPhone
Then I gotta clear em cause my girl be checking my phone
I'm in the Bentley with the mind blown
When I'm in that pussy, honey, I'm home

You dun been good, but you can do better
I dun been wet, but I can get wetter
Come and make it Wayne down on me3Embed
