Bitches Come A Dime A Dozen, I Fuck 'Em Sistas Cuzzins
Its A revolving door Pussy Go And Pussy Comin
And When It Go To You Its Comin Back To Me Wit Money
I Told Her Put them Shoes On And Keep My Paper Runnin
I Put My Mack, Downnnn Just Like A G Supposed To
And If She Dont Come Home Wit It Than She Sleepin Over
I Got Her Creepin Over, We Do It Than Its Over
I Like Them A'Maries, You Can Have Them Omarasas
Them Niggas Down Below Us, Baby We Up And Over
Im Tryin To Get Inside That Thang That Sit Between Ya Shoulders
Im Talkin Large Totals, Im Talkin Large Motives
Im Talkin Burner Rubber That Melted Pirelli Odor
Im Hoppin Out Unoticed, You Lookin At My Biiitch
You Wanna Holla You Can Holla Take Her On A Trip
But When The Deed'S Done, You Gotta Send Her Back...

I Got Done Fuckin A Man Now This Bird Is Callin Me Screamin

See I Know He Gotta Man But Im Coofey In The Otha One
Cuz He Can't Get Tight, When He Hear I Pipped Anotha One
I Dont Fall In Love With Them, Come And Than Im Done With Them

Would'Ve Thought Somebody Threw Me A Camera The Way I Caught A Flash Back...
