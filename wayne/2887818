41 ContributorsLoyal to the Soil Lyrics
That money stack tall but only partially my focus
So compassionate, struggle hard for me to cope with
Do a lot for others, not for credit or to soak in
But to have an impact on direction that they go in
Grounded by the roots, hooked to the soil
Recognize the rumble that we're in, yeah it's royal
Crabs in the barrel, wrapped up in foil
Kids grow up scars that are rubbed now with oil
And life done changed a bit but I can't grow apart
For those in my position that don't feel me, grow a heart
I grew up round love but we had a slower start
Hooping on the tree and fighting at the park
Luckily we had guidance, we was more blessed than others
We was the deepest family, nobody had more cousins
The street lights would flicker everybody running no huddle
Cause if you didn't make it everybody got in trouble

I won't let that money define me
I let my struggles refine me
I know my angels behind me
Young, rich, and in the sticks tryna find peace
I ain't get high and I ain't sell dope
People ask "why?" I did it for my folks
Wanna slice the pie then you gotta have hope
Take the plan serious or watch it go in smoke
Watch it go in smoke, watch it go in smoke
Watch it go in smoke, watch it go in smoke

Uh, chin to the clouds, all 10 on solid ground
Sipping purple Whitney Houston, never touch the Bobby Brown
When it comes to the crown, I done dreadlocked it down
Rest in peace my daddy Rabbit, he in Heaven hopping 'round
I been outchea on the grind, I want mine on time
Keep it a hundred, not even 99.9
It's Lil Tunechi the best rapper alive
I rep five, invite your girl to my suite at the Loews, she left high
Oh my in a double R, I'm re-ready to die
My pockets fat as Precious but what's more precious than time
Cause life is too short, I got that from Too $hort
Couldn't ball, I was too short
But rich, like I play two sports
Flag red like scarlet
Keep my head in my wallet
Leave the BS in the toilet
Leave the BS on the Charmin
With TF on my garments
I wear Trukfit like Ralph Lauren
And I'm loyal to my soil
Straight from hell, I mean New Orleans
Tunechi

I won't let that money define me
I let my struggles refine me
I know my angels behind me
Young, rich, and in the sticks tryna find peace
I ain't get high and I ain't sell dope
People ask "why?" I did it for my folks
Wanna slice the pie then you gotta have hope
Take the plan serious or watch it go in smoke
Watch it go in smoke, watch it go in smoke
Watch it go in smoke, watch it go in smoke
They said you wanna make it so here's the keys to survival
Get you a work ethic, go about it maniacal
Carry your family, all the great ones on that Mariah flow
Come to the neighborhood, show a kid to throw a spiral
All about your time, that's the best thing to give
A message from the distance hardly ever stay in ear
Gotta keep a presence even with your relatives
Cause we all carry gifts like Santa and the deers
I come through with no security
I grew up in the slums ain't no fear in me
Now the lames come and go and no forgetting me
They in love with the life and I don't know Billie Jean
Look at my demeanor, see loyalty in my background
Love me cause I'm solid, not because I became a cash cow
Tryna make jobs for younglings, that's on the ave now
That's why I can't have a barbecue and don't have a pat down

I won't let that money define me
I let my struggles refine me
I know my angles behind me
Young, rich, and in the sticks tryna find peace
I ain't get high and I ain't sell dope
People ask "why?" I did it for my folks
Wanna slice the pie then you gotta have hope
Take the plan serious or watch it go in smoke
Watch it go in smoke, watch it go in smoke
Watch it go in smoke, watch it go in smoke6Embed
