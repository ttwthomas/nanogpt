50 ContributorsPreach Lyrics
With my first hundred Gs bought my mom a house
Bitch, don’t try to suck my dick if you got cotton mouth
Watch these snitches, man, these rats think they Mighty Mouse
In the kitchen, Arm & Hammer, just the right amount
Got the dope spot popping, dope spot jumping
Car parked by itself, robot stunting
And it’s voice activated, I just tell it something
I ain’t even gotta press a button
Viper with the rally stripes, I don’t eat no Rally’s
I don’t eat my words, nigga, I don’t eat no salad
I got too much on my plate, I got too much on my palate
Never seen my car before, it’s like a unicorn in traffic
Too much fucking talent, rap Shakespeare, go Hamlet
You other boys could kiss the game goodbye, be romantic
Please don’t worry, Nancy, all my weed is organic
If my children end up smoking
I'll whip they ass if they don’t pass it
Hold up, I just got a package
I let my bitch test it, with flying colors, passed it
Burning money fast like fire on the plastic
You dead man walking throw some tires on your casket
They say niggas in wheelchairs is half dead as it is
I still keep the heat on me, attitude cavalier
Boy, I think your whole clique’s Summer’s Eve, Massengill
Monastat 7, Vagisil
And my name don’t need no adjectives
And my flow don’t need no ad-libs
The boot, the battlefield
Flag red, like I’m Russian, call me Vladimir
Took a picture with the pistol, gave it rabbit ears
These niggas got fast careers, fast as Batmobiles
My bitches got sex appeal, they like sex and pills, for reals
I’m sorry if you hate you, and I’m sorry for the wait, too
You might also like
Boom – It’s my shot like Biloxi
Even my shadow don’t trust me
Big dog in this shit, like a Husky
285, 20 pounds of musty
Stopped by the spot, had to serve Pooh bear
He buy one, I front him one, so I left two there
In a two-seater, pull up popping 2Pac
Didn’t have a safe, so I stashed it in my tube sock
Eat so much Benihana's I need nunchucks
You just a old nigga always saying, "Big bruh"
You a bad bitch always saying, "Big Daddy"
You a real nigga talking ‘bout you want a selfie
Uh, a baby bottle with my shit in
And my role model was a kingpin
I say, "Let’s work," he say, "Let’s work"
Let your next work be your best work

And it’s that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
And I’m so sorry for the wait, too
From New Orleans to the A, TRU
You test my homies, we ace you
Tity, these niggas monkeys in ape suits
I got a city, got a ocean, got a lake view
She took some shots til she shot down a grey goose
Ooh, this that Sorry 4 The Wait Deuce28Embed
