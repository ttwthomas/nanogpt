17 ContributorsWhite Girl (Remix) Lyrics
You know we keep that white girl—Christina Aguilera
My jewelry too loud—baby girl, I can't hear ya
I need about 50 if them bricks is the topic
They know we run the streets, man, them boys better stop it
You know we keep that white girl—Christina Aguilera
My jewelry too loud—baby girl, I can't hear ya
I need about 50 if them bricks is the topic
They know we run the streets, man, them boys better stop it

Louis Vuitton doin nothing but wrong
The bricks they came from Panama
I shipped 16 to Arkansas
And sent the rest to Wichita
Meet us for the fever then
Going down in Cleveland
Yeah I put my tax on it, You don't want it leave it then
Niggas crying bout the drought, cause I'm out doing shows
87-32, Nigga I rocks my own clothes
I'm riding Murciélago, I parked the Gallardo
I got that off white, call it Nelly Furtado

You know we keep that white girl—Christina Aguilera
My jewelry too loud—baby girl, I can't hear ya
I need about 50 if them bricks is the topic
They know we run the streets, man, them boys better stop it
You know we keep that white girl—Christina Aguilera
My jewelry too loud—baby girl, I can't hear ya
I need about 50 if them bricks is the topic
They know we run the streets, man, them boys better stop it
You might also like
I got that white girl, that Lindsay Lohan
And all you gotta do is ask Lindsay Lohan
And if you like that blow, then girl I blow mines
So come and get this blow, and then you blow mines
And then you blow his, and then you blow his
I'm fresh out of Christina, but I got that Britney Spears (Ya dig?)
I got that white lady, so I'm drivin' Miss Daisy
And two grand flat get ya four and a baby

You know we keep that white girl—Christina Aguilera
My jewelry too loud—baby girl, I can't hear ya
I need about 50 if them bricks is the topic
They know we run the streets, man, them boys better stop it
You know we keep that white girl—Christina Aguilera

Bringin' straight cash, for them Benz's no plan
And you know these diamond Cartier lenses four grand
"Fab, four grand?!" - I ain't stutter man
'Less you hear me bangin' Street Di-di-di-di-dam
Get 'em by the hundred, I ain't talkin' bundles either (Nah!)
Love that white girl, I got Jungle Fever
Ok, It's blockanomiks me and fab goin' school ya
Order up the set, We gon bring it right to ya
Money on my mind like a fuckin' brain tumor
Play wit the bag the whole Brook comin' to ya (Brooklyn)
Rookie of the year cause the play I make
Ordered Seven n a half, I tossed em a cool 8 (for real)
And even though I'm on the two, I'm still twerkin fo'
Catch me in the kitchen with that girl, Marilyn Monroe

You know we keep that white girl—Christina Aguilera

I came in the game on some white girl shit
So why should the fuck should I change from talkin' white girl shit
(Christina Aguilera)
Yeah I love my bitch, You should see her in the water
Yea she does her shit
Say the Feds still watchin'? Well I'mma give 'em somethin'
Check billboards, Number 1 album in the country
The radio ban, the snow video play
Guess what, fuck nigga - we still talkin' yay
We keep that white girl, like to call her Tammie
Born in Columbia, she move to Miami
Hilary Clinton, she my best friend (Tell 'Em)
Even co-signed for that new white Benz
Yeah I'm stickin' to tha script, the strippers they could vouch
Fuck ya IQ, cuz ya brain in ya mouth
Shoes on the Beamer, Niggas call her Trina
I back that ass up on the screen, I can see ya

You know we keep that white girl—Christina Aguilera
My jewelry too loud—baby girl, I can't hear ya
I need about 50 if them bricks is the topic
They know we run the streets, man, them boys better stop it
You know we keep that white girl—Christina Aguilera
My jewelry too loud—baby girl, I can't hear ya
I need about 50 if them bricks is the topic
They know we run the streets, man, them boys better stop it3Embed
