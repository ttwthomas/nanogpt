2 ContributorsSomeone To Love Me (Bad Boy Remix) Lyrics
(It's a shame that y'all put me in such a box... Check it!)
Ayo Mary, I want you to talk to em like you supposed to
Come on

Looking for someone to love me
I’m-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

I’m no angel, there's so much I can take
Calm down, patience, don’t lose your temper, hold on, wait
I’ve got issues just like you, sometimes I get so confused
I’m strong but I can break, I be prayin so hard to get thru the day
Bad thoughts in my mind I can’t shake
Having nightmares in the day can you relate?
Please somebody calmly wake me
I can’t let this cold world take me, I was looking

My drama, my karma
My love, my life, dear momma
The war’s I’ve fought, scars that I’ve garnered
The hustle, I got that honest from my father
Mix me with violence, blend me with peace
Combine me with hate and I can’t face defeat (nope)
I did it all in a week
Still incomplete as I stand on my feet
It take a lot to still dance to the beat
Skin more cold and callous than concrete
I love swimming but there's just one ski
In a rich man’s chique hotel with bed sheets
Uh ah, you know what I’m looking for
You might also like
Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

It’s my life, my life, word to Mary
Niggas can’t fuck with me, Virgin Mary
Go ahead make my day, dirty Harry
Weezy, fuck the world, pop the cherry
Everybody pushing but I don’t fall back
And everybody looking but blind to the fact
The clock on the wall say it’s time for some action
Now you can take that to the bank and cash in
I’m feeling myself, fuck if they feeling me
Can’t spell them without me, it's them or me
Yesterday was a memory
Looking in the mirror at my enemy
But today I’m...

Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

My rise, my falls, enemies wanna see me crawl
My ups, my downs, y'all know I’ve been around
But sometimes it bothers me when I hear people say a non truth
Am I sane, am I crazy, pick one there all the same
In this world we’re living in, I’ma make mistakes, I’m only human
I was...
Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeahEmbed
