(Ear Drummers!)
Yeah, yeah
Mike WiLL fuck with me
Yeah, uh

Yeah the flow is ice cold, but I'm a hot boy
You out here fuckin' anything then you's a thot, boy (damn)
What you call a dozen bricks? A bouquet, nigga (woo)
Only trust them two letters, AK, nigga (boom)
Yola whippin', I'm the chef, gourmet, nigga (Young)
That Rollie lookin' like it's doin' ballet, nigga (dance)
House six stories, nigga, that's a true story (story)
Rafaela Cuban linkin', call me 2:40
Yeah I swear these thirsty bitches need to drink some water (water)
I'm just tryna put a hundred mil' up for my daughter (daughter)
Straight player, yeah I think I got that from my father (uh)
Coupe don't cost a half a mil', dawg don't even bother
Catch-catch me with the gang, gang, I'm gang affiliated (hey)
If I want it, go get it, never hesitated (never hesitated, uh)
I can stretch that 28 a long way, nigga (yeah)
I can count these blue hundreds all day, nigga

Big house, long hallways
Got ten bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga (all day, yeah)
I'm the shit all day, nigga (all day, nigga)
Yeah, poppin' shit all day, nigga
Fireworks, big house, long hallways
Got ten bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga (all day, yeah)
Whip the shit all day, nigga (all day, nigga)
Yeah, whip the shit all day, nigga
You might also like
Whip it like a big booty bitch
Like a cup of coffee with a spoon in it
There's a pot of gold, no food in it
Culinary arts, let the students in
I'm the teacher, baby, Chef Tunechi in
And I whip it hard if it come easy
Whip it up like I'm Young Jeezy
Free pussy and Free Meechie
Big smoke got me deep breathin'
Deep dick got her sweet dreamin'
You ain't shit, you just pre-season
You ain't lit, you just pre-heated
Can't quit, I'ma keep leanin'
Smoke gas, I'ma keep premium
Green, green, and the money senior
Dope man with a hundred needles
No ass ever come between us
Dirty cash, not a money cleaner
Use the black card to split the coke
Jungle fever, cheatin' on the Visa
Speakin' of jungle, bitch work at Cheetahs
Had stripes since my first Adidas
Bought pints now I purchase liters
Shark bite, I'm a person eater
Walk light on the dirt beneath you
I'm in the throne and you in the bleachers
All day long, even on the weekends
Get off my lawn, cuttin' on the sprinklers, yeah
Big house, long hallways
Got ten bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga
Yeah, I'm the shit all day, nigga
Yeah, presidential suite or the penthouse

Black skinny jeans, get the lint out
Damn, I left my lint roller at your bitch's house
That's his house
She sent some nude pics for me to pick out
The pussy fat and pink like a pig, I'ma pig out
Yeah I'm Blood, but I got some cool Crips that I can send out
Ain't no loose lips, take the cruise ship, ain't tryna swim out
Brrrt, brrrt, that the money counter, let it print out
Brrrt, brrrt, that's the Uzi, we call it big mouth
Huh, I lost my mind but I'm still mastermindin'
Tryna find the silver linin', found the platinum linin'
Cut his head off, cut his arms off, look like Aphrodite
Young Money all day, nigga, and mañana

Yeah, big house, long hallways (okay)
Got ten bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga (all day, yeah)
I'm the shit all day, nigga (all day, nigga)
Yeah, poppin' shit all day, nigga
Fireworks, big house, long hallways (yeah)
Got ten bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga
Yeah, with your bitch all day, nigga (all day, nigga)
Yeah, give her dick all day, that's how it works
I store that cocaine on that gutta bitch
Yeah, they can't check her left and right
Ooh, my boo, yeah, no one's fuckin' with it
Uh, I got 'em bathin' like they elephants
Fireworks
Give her dick all day, yeah that's how it works
All day, nigga
Coppin' shit all day, nigga, fireworks
Mula
Mula, baby4Embed
