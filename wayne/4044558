11 ContributorsLeverage Lyrics
I was thinkin', I was like "I wonder if muhfuckas'll remember that"
Like, not only like "He was great, he was the best rapper alive or he was"
Like, I wonder if muhfuckas really remember me
For the innovator I am
And I was thinkin' (Thinkin')
I was thinkin' how saturated things get these days
And, and how easy it is to forget the greatness
The greatness of something or someone
And, um, today I, I plan to
Take 10 minutes or 15 minutes out of your day and my day to, um
Elaborate on the subject

I'm the talk around town, shit, you all talk
Money in the bank got me smilin' like Paul Wall
I don't even see it, I just raw dog
Shit, my side bitch a player, she a ball hog
Always on the go, I'm a Rolling Stone
Steal your bitch, I don't need the swag, just need my cologne
Like this a Rolex, baby, this ain't Michael Kors
And you need to suck the dick before I hit exhaust
If I had a penny every time they ask me what it cost
I could buy every island I seen on Lost
I could buy myself a whole commercial plane
Fuck it, get a blimp and let it say my name
And I ain't socializing when I talk about this aim
Re-rollin' all those roaches, was losing my way
Forgot me so much times, now you remember my name
Well that's the same, same, same, now you postin' my game?
You might also like
Me, myself, and I, holy trinity
If I fucked around and died, you'd remember me
I got leverage in these streets, I got leverage in me
I got leverage in these streets, I got leverage in me
Me, myself, and I, holy trinity
If I fucked around and died, you'd remember me
I got leverage in these streets, I got leverage in me
I got leverage in these streets, I got leverage in me

Serve Perc, twenties, like outta the Honda
Walkin' with Jeffrey, look like Hotel Rwanda
Blessed in since a youngin'
If I alert one the Codys, then they would do it for nothin'
Flirtin' with your BM on my BBMs and news, I'm keepin' 'em
Got so much class, but never finished school, like, "who was teachin' 'em?
Said "fuck the odds," and every evening, I'm in the streets again
I never banged my homie's souls 'cause I ain't leavin' 'em
So I speak for them, make that heat for them
For all my dead beat brothers, 'til they meet again
So don't ask me about my motives or my reasoning
See these hustles in my veins, I was born to win
On my darkest days, bag the pills, had to order in
Big homies, phones high, can't say co-ordinance
Even though my momma losin' and I'm goin' in
So I'm born to win
Me, myself, and I, holy trinity
If I fucked around and died, you'd remember me
I got leverage in these streets, I got leverage in me
I got leverage in these streets, I got leverage in me
Me, myself, and I, holy trinity
If I fucked around and died, you'd remember me?
I got leverage in these streets, I got leverage in me
I got leverage in these streets, I got leverage in me1Embed
