You pussy poppin', I'm gone shoot back
And If you do me, then I'll do you back
There's 69 ways that we can do that, so come on
Laawwd!
Shake it like a dog
Wrooof!
Turn around back it up now catch the ball
Wrooof!
Catch the wall
Wrooof!
Now catch the wall
Wroof!
Just pick ya ass up
Yah!
And let it fall slow
Little nigga but in that pussy
I stand tall
And tell ya man I beat up niggas like HARPO
You seen "The Color Purple"
And we don't smoke dat green
We smoke the color purple
Yah!
And we're not gonna stop just because
The feds and the cops are watching us
See we don't give a damn wat they say
We do wat we want to
Young money mu'thaf*cka
Got them hoes watching us
I say my niggas high
I like to f*ck
And I can look dead in her face
And see that she wants to
And when we finish making love I say
Give me time baby
Just give me space
I don't want you around
Like bitch get off me
Bitch, bitch get off me
And when we finish making love I say
Give me time baby
Just give me space
I don't want u around
I'm gon be hollerin like bitch get off me
Bitch, bitch get off me
Maacckk maaiinne
I say my chinky black bullets make a bitch get off me
(bitch get off me!)
I get like Lauren Hill I be killin em softly
(killin em softly!)
I just got copped a new whip and the interior toffee
(interrior toffee!)
And I skim milked the paint to make it look like coffee
(it look like coffee!)
Folgers I dun told cha
How to roll up
(how to roll up)
20's on my coupe and 26's on my Rover
(26's on my Rover bitch!)
Money in my pocket and patron in my cup
(alright ah yah yah yah)
N I got bitches on my dick n I got bitches on my nuts
(we ain't neva lost)
Natural born hustler
Shiesty individual
Play with my bread
Shit'll end up critical
I ain't just start spittin flame
Boo been a fool
Balla baby
Pool in the living room
Retractable roof
Maybach coupe
I Chloe my bitch bags
And Guiseppi her boots
We do it B.I.G like gimmie the loot
U trippin off 1 hoe
Pimp I get em in twos
And when I'm done I tell em
Give me time baby

Like bitch get off me
Bitch, bitch get off me
And when we finish making love I say
Give me time baby
Just give me space
I don't want u around
Like bitch get off me
Bitch, bitch get off me
They say what goes up must come down
Well I'm high as a muthaf*cka right now
Do me a favor, lay a layer of pillows on the ground
Run around in a pair of shoes so fly
And the box came with a parachute no lie
Spitta nigga I be a sight for sore eyes
Spitta nigga I'm a delight to ya whole eyes
Neva give a inch to a bitch
For the po-Lice
And we're not gonna stop just because
The feds and the cops are watching us
See we don't give a damn wat they say
We do wat we want to
Young money mu'thaf*cka
Got them hoes watching us
I say my niggas high
I like to f*ck
And I can look dead in her face
And see that she wants to
And when we finish making love I say
Give me time baby
Just give me space
I don't want u around
Like bitch get off me
Bitch, bitch get off me
And when we finish making love I say
Give me time baby
Just give me space
