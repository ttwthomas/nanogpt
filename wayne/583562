2 ContributorsI Like It Lyrics
I sit here alone everyday
Everyday at my window, my living room window
Thinkin' 'bout you
I watch the kids as they play
What happened to Nintendo? Where did it go?
No time for video games, no time for SEGA
Oh no, but I'm in space
I don't know if it is this girl face
Or how she taste, but I like it
 (x2)
(Good God)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I got myself into

But I like it, ooh I like it
When you doin' it, how I like it
So keep doin' it, how I like it
Cause I like it, ooh I like it

I like sex in the mornin', I like sex at night
I like sex on the weekends, is that alright?
Alright, alright, all night, alright?
Come on, I got shampoo chilled
Took off her dress but kept on the heels
Damn baby, you so exotic
Holler my name loud when I'm inside it
No shame, I ate her pride
Tickled the pearl tongue and came up smilin'
Two dips a dip, and now we ridin'
Bed to the sink, sink to the shower
Back to the sink, back to the bed
It's 3:45, now I'm gettin' some head
You might also like
I get cold, I get goosebumps
And I head out the door, that's similar to her name
I'm so cold, but with her, all alone
I'm so high, I'm nearly hittin' the flame
She told me her name is Crazy
And I said "Hi, they call me Insane"
Crazy and Insane is so high up in the tree
F.U.C.K.I.N.G

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know what I will do
I guess I, I guess I, would just die
Go to Heaven and wait on you

Ooh, I think I like you
If you was a poem, I would recite you
The bed could be our ring, I wanna fight you
Put my key in your ignition, let me ignite you
The cops keep comin', the cops keep comin'
To my front door like I'm trynna do somethin'
They don't understand that I'm involved with a woman
That love to make noise when she feel it in her stomach
I'mma have to talk to the neighbors
Matter of fact, let me take a walk by the neighbors
I don't know what the hell wrong with the neighbors
And what they expect when an animal is matin'
Knock on the door, like chicky-chicky-check it
Life is a party, don't ricky-ricky-wreck it
Y'all will call the cops and report a domestic
When I'm just trynna kill a problem called erection
Head in the coupe, call it sex on wheels
I'm a big dude, I treat sex like meals
She ride me for breakfast, I'm on top for lunch
And behind her for dinner, for dessert she say "yum"
I sit here alone everyday
Everyday, everyday in living room window
I watch the kids as they play
What happened to Nintendo?
No time for video games, no sir
No time, no time for SEGA
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what I got myself into
But I like her, I like her, I like her
And if she leave, I don't know what I'll do
I do know, I'd go to Heaven
And darlin' I'mma wait on you

I like it (Say what?)
I like it (Say what?)
(Say what?)
Yeah, baby
She likes it
She likes it
She likes it
I'm a R.O.C.K.S.T.A.R
Young Mula, baby
She likes it
And she likes it
Cause I do me, how she likes it
I'mma do me, how she likes it
She know I do her, how she likes it
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a movie
I'mma make a love
I'mma make a love movie
I'mma make a movieEmbed
