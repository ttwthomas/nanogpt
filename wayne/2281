Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Heheh, C3, hello)
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, hello)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Hehehe, get lifted)
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, I get lifted)
Yeah, yeah, so get lifted, yeah
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, haha)

I am sittin' on the clouds
I got smoke coming from my seat
I can play basketball with the moon
I got the whole world at my feet
Playin' touch football on Marijuana Street
Or, in a marijuana field, you are so beneath my cleats
Get high, so high
That I feel like lying
Down in a cigar, roll me up and smoke me
'Cause (I feel like dying) hahaha

Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Haha, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Hahahaha)

Swimmin' laps around a bottle of Louis the XIII
Jumping off of a mountain into a sea of codeine
I'm at the top of the top, but, still I climb
And if I should ever fall, the ground will then turn to wine
Pop, pop
I feel like flying
Then I feel like frying
Then (I feel like dying)

Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Psst!)

I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
And violets are blue, roses are red
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead
Wish I could give you this feeling
I feel like buying
And if my dealer don't have no more
Then (I feel like dying) yeah
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying38Embed
