4 ContributorsTattoo Girl (Foreva) Lyrics
Man I done seen a lot of nice tattoos out here lately
And I'm kinda stuck with it
Rock-rock it, we don't stop, stop, stop

Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You forever
Stuck with me

See everyday I asked a new question
To get right through all life a lessons
It's funny to me and I'm noticing that
Every tattoo I see is on the small of a back
It's like damn I can't refuse
All the great ideas that come with tattoos
Like first the rose, then the butterfly
Then the small little catch themes catch your eyes
And even Angelina Jolie got those
The only way you see those is with no clothes
So there's a few who knows
Maybe Brad Pitt know
Billy Bob saw a few so she got some more
I'm sayin'...
You might also like
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me

Uh, she got eyes by her pussy
So when I go down they always lookin'
Then I told her get my name
In all red ink, blood game
Then we cut off the night lamp
And I get up on that ass like a tramp stamp
My tattoo goddess
Love is an art and I'm an artist

And one of the hot har-hardest tattoos I ever seen
Is the one on my wife, one that you'll never see
It ain't no tiger, no snake, or no keychain
She went to FAMU, so of course she know T-Pain
Strictly simplicity, ink on your tities be wiggly jiggly
You'll never get rid of me, I'm permanently on the arm
So when I'm looking for them tattoos in the bed
I be like...
There you are
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me
Stuck with me
Yeah
I forever stuck with me

Yeah, you got people round the world that's wearing tattoos
You got actors, entertainers in blue collar suits
The whole wide world is wearing tattoos
You got athletes and doctors just like you
I say...

Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
Stuck with me
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You are forever
You are hello
You are hello
You are, you are forever
I said you are hello
You are hello
You are forever
Said you are, you are
You are, yeah
I said you are, you are, you are
I said you are, you are, you areEmbed
