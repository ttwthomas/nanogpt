2 ContributorsBling Bling (Radio Version) Lyrics
Man I got these broads iceing it up
While my lil B.G.s on the bus puttin' out cigarette butts
But me personally playboy I done had bad luck
And I'm a always show love to my cut
Hit tha club light tha lights up
The Cash Money motto is to drank 'til you throw up
Point the broad out guaranteed I can pluck
Cause Wodie I'm tattooed and barred up
Medallion iced up
Rolex bezelled up
And my pinky ring is platinum plus
Earrings be trillion cut
And my grill be slugged up
My heart filled with anger lost, stranded as a youngster
Stack my chesse up
Cuz oneday I'm a give this street life up
Beef I don't discuss
Wodie outta line wodie gone get his head bust
Cash Money millionaires plus
Don't touch broad if you can't pluck the broad
Twenty inches with t.v.'s is a must
By the year two thousand Lil' Wayne gone tear this game up

Boss B, slow down in the Jag you lost me
You know how slow the new Rolls Royce be
The number one rapper, dippin low low
In a compressor sippin mo-mo
Spend a lotta cheddar, look
My click couldn't be betta
I'm married to C.M.R. baby
Love it or leave it
Drop tops when it's hot
Strech hummer's when it's not
Light up the whole block when
You glance at my watch
It's Wayne baby, thugged out won't change baby
I'll do your main lady, in a blue navigaty
That's game baby, you can call me a game shooter
But since I drive a bubble people call me Lex Luger
I pull up in a expedition they be like ah no,no,no he didn't
Tattoes and fast cars, Do you know who we are?
I'm Lil' Weezy puttin down for C.M.R
You might also like
Bling bling
Everytime I come around yo city
Bling bling
Pinky ring worth about fifty
Bling bling
Everytime I buy a new ride
Bling bling
Lorenzos on Yokahama tires
Bling bling

It's the playa with tha Lex bubble
Candy coated helicopter with tha leather cover
If ya slirppin' not  take off the rubber
Then toss that broad cuz I don't love her
Balla, Manny bought a private plane
Then turned around and sold that thang to Juve and Wayne
They put 30 inch lorenzos on that thang man
You lil kids out there just don't understand

I'm a 1999 driver
I'm a uptown third ward Magnolia T.C. rider
Ole ignorant boy always stun'n
Big ballin' cahouney's you can see him when he comin'
Booted up Diamond up Golds be shinnin' up
All them diamonds be blindin' up
People at the second line be sayin' I be damn
Up in they best fits sayin' Juve got me damn

I be that playa with the ice on me
If it cost less than twenty it don't look right on me
I stay flossed out all through the week
My money long if you don't know I'm the B.G
I be dealin with your girl all in your home
Haters be like look at that benz on all that crome
Diamonds worn by everybody thats in my click
Man I got the price of a mansion 'round my neck and wrist
My Dawg Baby gettin' a special built machine
A mercedes benz seven hundred B 14
I know you haters can't believe that
I can't wait to see ya bustas face when ya see that
Man look at that
Girls wear shades just to stand on side of me
They say take that chain off boy ya blindin' me
All day my phone ringin' bling bling bling
Can see my earring from a mile bling bling
