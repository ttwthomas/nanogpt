Clear the set nigga
What, what, what, what

See I be ridin' on the block in the lex bubble
Ready to come out the trunk and make yo chest buckle
When I come I lay the sprays wit' K's by the truckload
Should've got out of my way you heard my clip shuffle
Now yall was on the block with shotguns
But when I finished, made it look like yall had pop guns
Dressed in black, long hair, long gats, lights off, no suntin'
Head to the back, no mask, I'm thuggin' (What?)
What you wan' do, if yo ribs start bussin'
Then 20 mo' nigga's follow in hummer's, so ain't nothin'
Look, 17 Ward is where I grew up at
So where a busta nigga standin' is where he blew up at
I blew up that CMB so respect my peeps
Or else you want yo life to be all over the streets
Now watch me the younger soldier bring u closer to death
A little more than you expect, nigga, I clear da set

You know they say Lil Wayne dem Hot Boy he will bust dem heads
Him calls on his gun and all dem bloody bodies dead
Dem, dem, really shouldn't try Lil Wayne 'cause he will play with K's
And will bust a nigga wide open and put his brains on display
Now, watch a nigga neighborhood, phhhh, go up in flames
They, They all got burnt, couldn't can't stand the heat
I bet none of them  jackers ain't gone test Lil Wayne
'Cause I, I clear the set messin' wit' me
You might also like
I find a nigga where he stay
Cock my iron release and spray
We gone ride or we gone play
It's on my mind nigga anyday
Make you die where you lay
Try me and see what shakes
Why nigga I ain't fake
Badda bye-bye now fly away
With them blood claw, lawd (Lord)
The M-O-B will take them nuts off, lawd
The must really think this is checkers boy, but why?
But to be this hot when you play wit' a peppa boy, now cry
Look, look, I don't mean no harm, but u might think I'm wrong
But if u play with me and my click, you'll blow up like a bomb
I, I upset yo home, throw slugs at yo dome
Just gimme the word and I shine the chrome braid my hair and it's on
Yall lil' boys shouldn't come against the uptown assassin
Jump out quick out of the jag and blow fire like a dragon
Soulja bandana wit' banana clips to fit in my sweeper
Once I hit the set look everybody burns like a heater

You know they say Lil Wayne dem Hot Boy he will bust dem heads
Him calls on his gun and all dem bloody bodies dead
Dem, dem, really shouldn't try Lil Wayne 'cause he will play with K's
And will bust a nigga wide open and put his brains on display
Now, watch a nigga neighborhood, phhhh, go up in flames
They, They all got burnt, couldn't can't stand the heat
I bet none of them  jackers ain't gone test Lil Wayne
'Cause I, I clear the set messin' wit' me
Now hold up as I bust back, watch playboy
Keep a dub sack, hey boy
Come to irritate yo day, boy
Watch yo chest separate, boy
When I cocks me Glock me done tossed dem buck shots
And done kill them blood clots, What the deal
Yall niggas wants some more of wit' this
Killas like us will take it to you front door with this
See hittin' corners ain't no real biggie
I'm used to be set in that water wit my still flippin'
I'm pistol grippin', ridin' wit my grill glistenin'
Niggas done caught up in beef 'til they still missin'
Now catch me in the black truck with chrome wheels twistin'
A lil' tipsy he gone lie, talkin' bout he gone kill yo Ms.'s
Now peep it out
We gone clear da set but watch'em, *sweep*, sweep it out
I'm cheap and cheaper and cops bustin' in yo people house
If the nigga wan' play I turn batter to flour
So nigga clear the set and bout 5 after the hour

You know they say Lil Wayne dem Hot Boy he will bust dem heads
Him calls on his gun and all dem bloody bodies dead
Dem, dem, really shouldn't try Lil Wayne 'cause he will play with K's
And will bust a nigga wide open and put his brains on display
Now, watch a nigga neighborhood, phhhh, go up in flames
They, They all got burnt, couldn't can't stand the heat
I bet none of them  jackers ain't gone test Lil Wayne
'Cause I, I clear the set messin' wit' me
I make 'em watch a nigga neighborhood, phhhh, go up in flames
They, They all got burnt, couldn't can't stand the heat
I bet none of them  jackers ain't gone test Lil Wayne
'Cause I, I clear the set messin' wit' me
With the blood claw, lawd (What)
With the blood claw, lawd (What)
With the blood claw, lawd (What)
Hot Boys untamed Guerillas, what1Embed
