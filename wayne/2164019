66 ContributorsWhite Girl Lyrics
Yeah
Please have my money on time
Please have my money on time, boy
'Cause my niggas run in salons
Just to shoot up baby moms, boy
Trap house jump out the gym
Trap house jump like LeBron, yeah
It's twenty-two five for the B
Eleven five for the Solange, yeah
Call a sixteen Montana, a eight a Steve Young
And a four a Brett Favre
My plug name is Hector
But back in his country, they call him Héctòr
She strip every day but Sunday
'Cause she still make time for the Lord
Got a red dot on top of your head
Like I got your ass on record
"Tune, don't be so cruel"
"Tune, don't be so rude"
Nah, fuck that
Fuck these lil niggas, fuck these lil dudes
Hey, by the gavel or the gun, nigga
I be creepin' like the shadow and the sun, nigga
Be more careful how you pick and choose your words, boy
'Cause I'll have you playin' scrabble with your tongue, nigga
Ooh, I'm Mick Jagger as a young nigga
Woo, pourin' Pink Panther in the punch, nigga
Think faster than these dumb niggas
We serial killers, you can get your Captain Crunch, nigga
Hey, it's Lil Wayne, nigga

Tell the cops I ain't no name giver
Icicles on my fingers from cocaine blizzards
Ayy, it's Lil Wayne, nigga, uh
I'm in the building, 'bout to hang pictures
Woo, I'm the ruler, it's a game of inches
Tryna make a mill' and make a meal in the same kitchen
Hey
