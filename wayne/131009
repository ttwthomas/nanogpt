Young, Young Mula, baby!
Hey!
Hey!
For the grown and sexy, say yeah

Shawty let your hair down, I'ma let the top down
We can ride around town, turn this bitch to our town
We can do it real big, bigger than you've ever done it
Everything you ever wanted, I can spend whatever on it
Baby, I'm a d-boy, you see my duffle bag
I don't see her panty line where her stomach at
She don't wear drawers, she like her pussy bald
And she don't like pets, but she cool with my dog
And she cook a nigga steak, she fix a nigga plate
She rub a nigga back like I'm in the NBA
And she know I'm in the game, but she know I don't play
She know just what to do to make me say I'm gon' stay
You might also like
But she know I gotta work, and she know I got work
She pack my socks, boxers, and t-shirt
She know I gotta work, and she know I got work
She pack my socks, boxers, and t-shirt

So if I call you my bitch, please don't take it wrong
And man, I miss my dawgs, so you know I ain't takin' long
I love it when you scream that, "I can't take it, it's too long"
See, my baby hold me down, she never hold me down
Yeah that's my Bonnie, better hold that nigga down
"Babe, shoot that nigga up," then we go home and fuck
That's my dog, she like it rough, that's my dog, ruff-ruff
And she know I gotta work and she know I got work
But she buy my drink, my pills, and my purp
And she know I gotta work, she know i got work
And she buy my drinks, my pills, and my purp

From the front door on the living room floor from the back
And she...  love to throw that ass back
She get on top and roll, she make my eyes roll back like
Baby, the way you ride me, I'll ride for you
Give me more brain than a zombie, I'll die for you
Then I die, then come back alive for you
I'll survive for you, I'm down for you
