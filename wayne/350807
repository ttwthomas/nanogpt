What up though?
Yes, this is the end of No Ceilings
I hope you enjoyed, I really do
Like I said it was all for you
Thank you I appreciate you, everything about you
And again, this was and is No Ceilings
Yeah, this is just a message, your beat ain't safe
Yeah, I just like to have fun
And so they ask why did I do this, why do you keep giving out free music?
Why do you do this, why, why? Because I'm Weezy
I'm different, I have plenty of it
So it's nothing for me to share
Priceless, that's why its free
Yeah, No Ceilings
Please don't forget the F
Yeah, Young Money!You might also likeEmbed
