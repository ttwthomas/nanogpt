LilWeezyAna
Yeah
DJ Raj Smoove, greatest DJ in the world
Weezy F Baby, best rapper alive
Let's go

Yeah, young Wayne
Up in this thang
The boy get money
Like the summer get rain
I got game
That's just that
Baby, I'm a player
Check my stats
She just wanna caress my tats
And then I jumps up in that pussy and run laps
Yeah, it's Weezy Baby
Now keep me in your mouth like you're teething baby
Haha, and I swear I go dumb
I smoke so much, niggas call me No Lungs
I'm just trying to stack mo' funds
Baby I'm a god, I should walk around with nuns
Haha, but I walk around with guns
Use your head or you'll walk around with none
Haha, and that'll be no fun
Now is my era
Bring terror
Like Pun
Fugue, roll up a 'Young L'
