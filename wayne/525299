5 ContributorsCompetition Interlude Lyrics[Question:
Are you still competitive in the rap game?]

Uhhm, competition is different these days
That competition is competing for my awesome fan base
My awesome fans
Attention, you know what I mean
For them to still say that they love me
And competing for they love and competing for them to still fucking with me
Things like that
That’s my competition these days and I love itYou might also likeEmbed
