That's my chains nigga, you hear 'em swangin'
Your left, your right, your left
All in your bitch face, I'ma be fuckin' her
Your left, your right, your left
But I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue

Army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue
Your left, your right, your left
Your left, your right, your left
Army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
Man I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue

Me and Ben Franklin cool
Yeah that's my dude
Been on him since lil faces
I got big faces too
Might bring tex back
That's how we move
My baby bro got stripes
More stripes than you
Everything bulletproof
And all you can't see through
Everything presidential
And that cost me too
When you go hard in Goyard
That's a new Mercedes coupe
Oh that's your bitch?
She been fucking me too
Your left, your right, your left
All my old hoes been in line since I left
We out the hood, we made it through
Drink good, we're faded too
My bankroll a lot of colors
But you know my favorite two
You might also like
Army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue
Your left, your right, your left
Your left, your right, your left
Army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
Man I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue

Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
You know I know you don't know
So help me to help you, help me to help you
'Cause all my niggas crazy and I stick with 'em
I must be crazy glue
Niggas thought I fell off, they must be crazy too
You get knocked the hell off
I must be Satan too
Ooh girl I love you so, and I preach not to love you hoes
But I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue
Getting paper so long
And the paper so long
Tell them haters so long
Tell 'em they was so wrong
You be with them niggas hating
Nigga you a hater too
Nigga better get some bitches
While you at it get some paper too
Ride with the doors off
Pour up, never doze off
Just met her for the first time
She wanna take the clothes off
She been going all night
She say she love to show off
She fuck with me 'cause I'm hard
She say them niggas so soft

Army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue
Your left, your right, your left
Your left, your right, your left
Army green and navy blue
Army green and navy blue
Man I really love the paper too
That army green and navy blue
We love the paper man
Army green and navy blue
Y'all know what it is man
We gon' stay man, gettin' this motherfuckin' cash nigga
Bitch, yeah1Embed
