24 ContributorsLet Me Thru Lyrics
Now I'm just sittin' here at this red light
With my emergency brake on
The wheels spinnin', whip lookin' like it got new skates on
I'm talking 9.8 seconds boy, this ain't gonna take long
Then I hop out at the finish line like, "is this what you waitin' on?"
I'll tell you what, homie, you ain't gotta wait long
All I'm thinkin' bout this is trophy I'mma take home
Give 'em somethin' they can hate on
Confetti all over the place, girls poppin' out that cake holmes
And my skin tone should be
The only thing you askin' me about race holmes
Yea, I'ma tell you what you not gonna do
Cause if the wing pop out the back of that Ferrari
Then the Bugatti got one too
I'm tryna throw these great balls of fire
I'm talking woo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom
Jesus Christ, feel like I got two Bibles out, zoom-zoom
And I'm like

Hold up, yeah, you gotta let me through
Yea, you gotta let me through
And I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too
You gotta let me through
You gotta let me through
Cause I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too
See T-Pain LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
I got too much rubber to burn, fire hazard
Lil Tune, the tycoon
Cash Money mascot, it's hot under this costume
Got pedals I've never stepped on
Buttons I've never pressed on
Backseats I've never effed on
Police, still get the F bomb
I still ride with my niggas, money don't change a gangster
And when I'm asked to pull a few strings
I pull 'em until they untangle
Watch me donuts as she throw up like hell yeah
More money, more problems, I'm surprised I still have black hair
I feel like racing, racing, who racing?
Don't give up the location
And if we bet, I win then hit the strip club
And go throw at them pole babies
Riding so fast with the top down
The wind sound like a standing ovation
Tunechi, fast and furious, I like my bitch fast and flirtatious

Hold up, yeah, you gotta let me through
Yea, you gotta let me through
And I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too
You gotta let me through
You gotta let me through
Cause I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too
No I don't know why y'all niggas think
I been slackin' like I ain't been on my shit
Until I pass by in that fast ride and now your bitch is on my dick
I'm talkin' bout, slidin', back and forth up in your tub
I fuck that shit on that video, now that video is on Pornhub
I say ridin' through FSU in that fam, fam
I've been packin' stacks
And now we back to back on them can ams
Lam-borghini paint
I remain to reign over these lame-ass rap niggas
Matter fact, niggas packed in the back
Of the 'Lac with a knapsack full of Macs and snacks
For the attack, you niggas ain't got time to react
Nappy boy in this bitch bring the calvary back
Teddy Pain motherfucker, I don't slack on the track
Red dot to the dome, put a gap in your hat
Chevy leanin' like a bitch, boy you have to relax
Double sided like a battlin' axe
You gettin' mad cause your rappin' is wack
And all the shit that you been doin' recently
My niggas laughin' at that

Hold up, yeah, you gotta let me through
Yea, you gotta let me through
And I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too
You gotta let me through
You gotta let me through
Cause I stay ridin', you gotta let me through
And my niggas slidin', so you gotta let them too23Embed
