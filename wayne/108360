5 ContributorsNo Worries Lyrics
Look me in my face, I ain’t got no worries
I ain’t got no worries, I ain’t got no worries
See them shroomies keep me up, so I ain’t got no worries
I ain’t got no worries, I ain’t got no worries
You see money, right there, (yeah) that’s Tunechi, right there (turn it up)
(yeah) That’s Mack Maine, right there, and we ain’t got no worries
You see pussy, right there, red bone mangoes, right there
See them shroomies right there we ain’t got no worries

See that pistol off in my waist, so I ain’t got no worries
Got them snowflakes in my chain, so them diamonds glowing in flurries (Bling!)
Got your chick in all in my face, tryin' to feed me all of that curry
And I was 'bout to eat shit up, but that kitty cat was too furry
And I’m like yay girl you crazy, baby girl you crazy
I’m not lazy I go Bronco up in that pussy – Willis MacGayhee
You should pay me just to fuck you
Few stacks, just pluck you
I got golden arms, platinum fingers
It’s a privilege for me to just touch you, bitch
Yea, got your bunny all in my whip
Got bout 20 strong in my clip
And my money long as my dick
I watch birds fly on my strip
I watch turns die on my strip
I watch slugs fly out my grip
Anytime them fucks eyein' my chips
See that Villain, so trill
That Villain boy so trill
I’m top shelf in that supermarket and all you niggas no frills
That black card in my pocket, I ain’t spendin' no deals
Drop that molly in the champagne
(Why?) Cuz I ain’t taking no pills

Look me in my face, I ain’t got no worries
I ain’t got no worries, I ain’t got no worries
See them shroomies keep me up, so I ain’t got no worries
I ain’t got no worries, I ain’t got no worries
You see money, right there, (yeah) that’s Tunechi, right there (turn it up)
(yeah) That’s Mack Maine, right there, and we ain’t got no worries
You see pussy, right there, red bone mangoes, right there
See them shroomies right there we ain’t got no worries

It’s Busta, Bust in the place, I ain’t got no worries
Cuz I’m bustin' all in her face til her vision start to get blurry
Yea, see me bout to get straight to it
And we getting to this shit early
Oh man, oh Lord oh bitch mercy
See the way we got em all thirsty
Bitch come and ride with me on this journey
Come and stride along my beef jerky
I’mma make it sweat the more we get dirty
Bitch had a perm but now her shit curly
It’s Young Money right here, it’s the conglomerate right here
See all this bread that I’mma peel off when I get to buyin everything up in here
Shit getting hot and getting all humid
Poppin that molly and actin all stupid
When they aks who the nicest is in the circle
Don't be mad cuz your name ain’t included
If you need water my flow be like fluids
See the way we be comin, intruded and booted
When I finish with 'em I leave em all wounded
Bitch you ain’t know where level, 5 mutants
See how this shit is really going, acting like they ain’t knowing
Gotta a nigga really digging in they pocket
Every time I ask, they open and closing
Look I hope you know what the fuck, what this shit is
When I dig in your stuff, makin you curse me
Go ahead and angle the pussy a whole ‘nother way
I ain’t got no worries biatch
Look me in my face, I ain’t got no worries
I ain’t got no worries, I ain’t got no worries
See them shroomies keep me up, so I ain’t got no worries
I ain’t got no worries, I ain’t got no worries
You see money, right there, (yeah) that’s Tunechi, right there (turn it up)
(yeah) That’s Mack Maine, right there, and we ain’t got no worries
You see pussy, right there, red bone mangoes, right there
See them shroomies right there we ain’t got no worriesEmbed
