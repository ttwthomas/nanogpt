4 ContributorsI’m a Dog Ya (Freestyle) Lyrics:
Welcome to Tha Carter, little shop of horror
Bloody like a period after d r a
Doctor I'mma dog, I'mma dog, I'mma dog you
Not Georgetown but I'mma uptown Hoya
Like Milloy no lawyers
I got that work come be my employer
Freestyling for you , no for me, for me no, no only for money
More, of the money i get i got that, yeah
Like a pot and a pan i rock that ,yeah
I sit back tell my bus driver where to go
:
Cause I don't wanna finish
They diminish I replenish
Scientific, I'm out this world ho
I wear bright red like a girl toe
No homo, fingernails dirty
I've been counting dirty money since 12:30
A-M, weigh them, if they short take them
Right back and spray him amen, yea
I just do my Wayne
And every time I do it I do my thing, yeaYou might also likeEmbed
