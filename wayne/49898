Get more money get get more money
Get more money get get more money
Cause slow money better than no money
And I make that fast cash I'm no dummy
Get more money get get more money
Get more money get get more money
Cause slow money better than your money
I think being broke is a joke and you so funny

I know money don't grow on trees I'm no dummy
But I grow trees and get more money, I sold 20s
I get kush, sour, purple and dro money
And I still get the E pill and yayo money
They say more money more problems well homie
I'mma just deal with the problems and get more money
I rap and I buy ghats we sho money
And push cats we have to decide like the old gumbies
I'm hungry and Im tryna fill up my whole tummy
It's a wrap like a mummy you cats got no money
Now I can make it rain,hail,and snow money
But the way my ice shine it will still look so sunny

Murda, murda, murda, murda, murda man
Heard I'm disturbin' and hurry alert the word
I'm workin' that Eddie Murphy thats that raw and I serve it
Two weeks in the game I got a car and a murda
Yea my heart in the burner my burner and my firm grip
Better straighten everything out I let that perm sit
Shout to them Hollygrove niggas on that hood shit
Know your nigga got it on lock like a full fist
Back of the head with the back of the Glock
Leave em in the back of the building back to the block
Yea we on the clock and the money is calling
And I hear my name over the shot said I'm responding
Wayne where are you I'm comin for you
When I'm on the road to riches bitch go pluck marbles
And I know the bread stale and the milk is spoiled
But if we don't eat we won't see tomorrow


I'm the hustler, getting paid for my occupation
When I was broke I sold coke to the population
I'm thorough so your girl ???? stop the hating
??? if I'm not mistaken
(Yo when the next album dropin?)
Sorry I got you waitin'
(Oh, you cook it up?)
Yep, im a chef but I don't rock the apron
(Do you belive in the lord?)
Sure but I'm hot as Satan
Everything I make is hot, I can't stop creatin
And my Mercedes do look crazy, in navy blue
The roof, glass, and the rims was born in 82'
That means they 26, I'm on some get money shit
You on some bummy shit
Your money is some funny shit
