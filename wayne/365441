7 ContributorsLollipop Lyrics
She said "He's so sweet,"
"I wanna lick the wrapper"
And she, she licked me
Like a lollipop
Like a lollipop

Shorty wanna thug
Bottles in the club
Shorty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps
Shorty wanna thug
Bottles in the club
Shorty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

Cute lil' mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair
Down her back like mine
I make her feel right
When it's wrong like lyin'
Man she ain't never
Had a love like mine
But Man, I ain't never
Seen an ass like hers
That -- in my mouth
Had me loss for words
Told her to back it up
Like berp berp
And I made that ass jump
Like jerp jerp
And that's when she
She licked me like a lollipop
Like a lollipop

Bottles in the club
Shorty wanna hump
Yah know I like to touch

Come and do it for you

Bottles in the club
Shorty wanna hump
Your know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps
