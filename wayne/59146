Ahem
Young Money in charge
Yes it's Lil Wayne but the moneys enlarged
Priorities Young Money and God
Now they want to know how I be getting money on Mars
Cause I be getting paid like outta this world
Hip hop is a bitch and I'm proud of this girl
But when the sharks come see the fish curl
This is my game you gone need a referral
I know more bout tree then squirrel
We dont talk much but that heat so verbal
Brand new Marc Jacobs peak color thermal
Gun outside of the gear, external
Im so fly, yall still at the terminal
I put you in the dirt, just because I see the worm in ya
Dirty South bitch, admire and acknowledge it
&& respect my conglomorate!You might also like1Embed
