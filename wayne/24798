16 ContributorsMake It Work For You Lyrics
Boy let me show ya how to make that crack
How to spend that money how to make that back
Girl let me show how to hit that strip
How to get that grip don't give back lip
Go head do what you do make it work for ya
{*repeat 4X*}

Put the coke in the pots whip it over the rocks
Ship it over the blocks it's movin' movin'
I do the damn thang I get a brick, shit
I don't let it sit quick I move the damn thang
I can show you how to mix that shit
How to whip that shit how to twist that wrist
I can show you how to get back more
And the shit that you get back is just as raw
Girl I can show you how to hit that Ave
With that big fat ass and go get that cash
But you know you got to give back half
I'm somethin' like a pimp man go get that cash
Boy I don't play when it comes to money
I guess that's why I'm okay when it comes to money
I got two coups a truck and one four door
I can pick up all my hoes and have a one for all
You might also like
Boy let me show ya how to make that crack
How to spend that money how to make that back
Girl let me show how to hit that strip
How to get that grip don't give back lip
Go head do what you do make it work for ya
{*repeat 4X*}

Copped ten sold five then I hide three
Baking soda residue I'm gone with the other two
Fuck a magic stick Jeezy got a magic wrist
David Copperfield on the stove all types of shit
Stack it up like Pringles all type of chips
AR-15 all type of clips
G.A. yeah Atlanta
Dipset Harlem World call Santana
Hit Jim on the hip Cam on the celly
Rico call Ace, I get 'em for R.Kelly
That's seventeen a chicken I know the birdman
140th and Lenox I know the birdgang

Boy let me show ya how to make that crack
How to spend that money how to make that back
Girl let me show how to hit that strip
How to get that grip don't give back lip
Go head do what you do make it work for ya
{*repeat 4X*}
Ugh, you can smell it through the wrapper
That's that shit nigga, sit it in a pamper
I still got two sittin' in the hamper
I let 'em sit and air out, or else you want them damper (Stupid)
My lil brother got piff on the campus (He do)
We call him the N.O. capo (Yeah)
We all in, this what we ride for (Yeah)
We got Cash Money on the table and underneath the floor
Shit it's like I got a pan how I heat the flow
Aye but I really got a pan when I heat the blow
Shit, Aye, DVLP this beat is so
Motherfuckin' G.I. Joe and the hydro
Got me high I can't see where I go
When the rap stop movin' you just follow the coke
And your bitch start choosin' she wanna ride with a pro
I'mma have that ho swallowin' coke
Birdman Jr

Boy let me show ya how to make that crack
How to spend that money how to make that back
Girl let me show how to hit that strip
How to get that grip don't give back lip
Go head do what you do make it work for ya
