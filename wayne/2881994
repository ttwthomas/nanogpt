3 ContributorsProstitue Flang Lyrics
I wouldn't care

I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you girl
See you don't ever have to worry about me as long as you keep it real
Whatever is on your mind speak on how you feel
Stay true to me and never lie to me
And don't ever keep no secrets no matter whatever

Met a bitch named Sarah, got a red Carrera
Wanna make me settle
But I can't but no trust in her cause she know all the lil' fellas
Whatever happened in the past baby, I ain't jealous
It take a real nigga to walk in these Margiellas
What happening baby, whats happening baby
Come hop on board with a capitain baby
I wouldn't care if you a prostitute
And hit every man in the world you ever knew
Just keep it real with me and I'mma do the same with you
Money like a chicken wing, it ain't a thang to Fool
What's poppin?
If you fucking with the kid you got options
Girl I swear I'll have you swimming with the dolphins
Shopping out in NYC we all topping, we all topping
 and we barking, I'm hopping out with bands on me Niemann Marcus
You doing right, I'll put your ass in the apartment, hey
We fucking up the shoe department, yeah
You might also like
I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
We be vibing when we be riding
No dull moments, never silent
She my fun girl, she so vibrant
And her past mans, I don't care 'bout it
(I don't care 'bout it)
Fuck your ex man pop that molly
Hop on top girl, Kawasaki
Every monday, we in Diamond
You my star girl, keep on shining
(yeah, yeah, yeah, keep on shining)
(yeah, haha)

I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you girl
See you don't ever have to worry about me as long as you keep it real
Whatever is on your mind speak on how you feel
Stay true to me and never lie to me
And don't ever keep no secrets no matter whatever

Kick it like Kung-Fu
I keep a secret, can you keep one too?
Its the same old one-two
I can fuck you in the spot, can fuck you where you want boo
Ha, I wouldn't care if you a prostitute
Cause I'm about the little things you do
I love to, love to make it rain on you
I spend some change with you
Popping champagne with you
To tell the truth you know I rock with you
Don't give a fuck if you a prostitute
That's my baby, that's my baby
Rolls Royce , new Mercedes
You ain't gotta feel insecure around me
Spill out all your feelings clean up on aisle 3
If you ever down baby you can dial me
"Where you need me at?", and that's where I'll be, yeah, yeah
Spill out all your feelings clean up on aisle 3, baby
I wouldn't care if you a prostitute
I wouldn't care if you were a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you girl
See you don't ever have to worry about me as long as you keep it real
Whatever is on your mind speak on how you feel
Stay true to me and never lie to me
And don't ever keep no secrets no matter whatever1Embed
