This is 9 tre news I’m Jimmy Jones here with your weather
We apologize for the drout all week but it looks like thunderstorms
All weekend. We fittin to make it rain on you motherfuckers (Ya Heard Me)

Just left the bank I took 50 from the teller (CashMoney)
I’m fittin to make it rain so getchu an umbrella
We also make it snow we cocaine gram sellers (That Yayo)
Ballin gettin high throwin dolla’s from the sky (balllllin)
Big reffer cloud got in storming inside (drizzlin)
Foreign outside I’m usually foreign when I drive (Speedin)
A buck sixty feels like you soaring in the sky
Blowing money on the liqiour (Twisted)
At the strip joint blowing money on the bitches (Let it rain)
We standin on the bar throwing money like a pitcher (Get money)
But nigga I ain’t slippin got a fully-loaded trigga
And that can cause a heatwave (getchu clapped haa)
That mean you diggin you a deep grave
Nigga’s Jump yo ass have ‘em missin you for 3 days (Where he at?)

Auto-matic with the money like Reggi for 3 (laughing)

I’m just trying to see my decimals speak
Now these niggas just lighter then some good shit to me (Ok)
These niggas sweet like a taheshin treat (Ok)
They say I’m full of hot air then I release the heat
Split a nigga from his teeth to feet (Daamn)

Pockets full of kitty, these niggas ain’t gettin money like I was

Tornado money can’t fit it in a rubberband (Naah)
Check tha news It’s goin be a cloudy forecast (And whaat)
And when I move a couple goons in that R Class (Yesir)
She want a Doughboy nigga that do numbers
A smile likle lightning and a ass like thunder (Yeeah)

And when it stop drizzlin the floors all flooded (Yessir)
In one night blew bezzle on charm money
Fuck it it’s nothin I’m still spendin Desert Storm money
