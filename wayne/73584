13 ContributorsThat’s What Niggas Do Lyrics
I'mma buy a Benz
Cause that's what niggas do
You understand me?
I'mma smoke weed
Cause that's what niggas do
I'mma pack a gat
Cause that's what niggas do
You understand me?
I'mma get drunk
Cause that's what niggas do
You understand me?
I'm not gon' change
Just cause a motherfucker's got money

They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
I wanna pop 'em up
And throw away the heat
I don't play
And when I do, I play for keeps
I'm from the jungle
Where the lion eat the sheep
Yeah, Bubba just come home
From the penitentiary
When I see him
I'mma put him in a Bentley
Young Carter
What it is, what it isn't
Deep water
My sign say 'Gone fishing'
I'm a wizard
Poof, my top missing
Let the sky in
And tell the bitch kiss it
I sip Big Mo
I drank Pimp C
Never put the cup down
(Never put the cup down)
Bitch I'm from Uptown
I said Uptown
Well life's a nasty bitch
Ass bust down
Ask what now
And the answer never differs
Little Weezy
Is that niggaYou might also like8Embed
