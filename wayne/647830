Girl come home with me and let me introduce you to my Grammy family like Encore Oscar and Emmy
Accolades I got many (Many) got that kinda gwop you gotta wheel in with a semi baby
Get your friends inside with me
Common girl just ride with me
Plenty of girls that wish they could be standing on the side of me
I can see the look up in your eyes
But the looking at your thighs, lips, and hips make a nigga naturize
Babe if cash rules than my click, we rising to the top
On a highway robbery, we doing 90 in the drop

I fly over water, in my own charter
Baby I can turn you on like a phone charger
Baby I can hit it like a motherfucking dodger
If you want a soldier baby I can be your sergeant
And girl if your gay umm I can be your Marvin
I like hot grits and toast in the morning
I hope you turn into a ghost in the morning
I pop you up like chicken pox
Shout out to my nigga, Jamie Foxx
We tighter than some sticky socks
I be in slickest drop, listening to some Iggy Pop
And I'm from the dirty I say "Fuck the broom, and a mop"
He's so sweet make her wanna eat the candy store

Lets go hit the strip baby, then go home and strip baby
