14 ContributorsWhat’s My Age Again? / A Milli Lyrics
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sis—

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Okay, a million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, I'm hopin' them bitches see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"
You might also like
That's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

Motherfucker, I'm ill
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Motherfucker, I'm ill
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
A milli, a milli, a milli, a milli, a milli
A milli, a milli, a milli, a milli, a milli
A milli, a milli, a milli, a milli, a milli

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're 23
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
(What's my age again?) That's about the time that she broke up with me
(Please stay with me) No one should take themselves so seriously
(Please stay with me) With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never wanna act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
I'm ill
Motherfucker I'm ill
Motherfucker I'm ill
Motherfucker I'm ill
What's my age again?6Embed
