24 ContributorsPlastic Bag Lyrics
Yeah, uh-huh, No Ceilings 2

Yeah, get a plastic bag
Throw it over his head, make him gag
Throw it over his head, make him gag
You flashed all night nigga, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Throw it over his head, make him gag

Go ahead, take a nigga cash
You flashed all night nigga, you deserve it
Get a bitch with ass
Drop her off at the nigga pad
Now she goin' through the nigga's stash
You slept all night nigga, you deserve it
Get a Jason mask
Run up in this shit and scare his ass
Where the drugs nigga? Where the cash?
His whole face sand white, we pistol whip it purple
Yeah, pistol whip it purple
Two words, on sight
Yeah, two words, on sight
Yeah, two words, on sight
It's gon' be a murder
Every time you see me, you know Mack be there
You know Hood be there, you know T be there
Family affair, don't you even dare
No, I double dare you to leave your chair
I'm gon' leave you there, I don't even care
And I'm killin' shit, white sheet affair
Gun on my shoulder like Tinker Bell
Take a nigga's shit, sell a nigga's shit
Make some extra money for the holidays
Merry Christmas nigga, I got gifts for niggas
In the back of my big body sleigh
I got pussy set up any time of day
Get you pussies set up any time of day
And your comrades better be about that
Combat like Johnny Cage
Oh you stuntin'? I don't like that shit nigga
I don't like that shit, nigga
I don't like that bitch nigga
And that bitch he with give me mixed signals
Oh yea, there's a lot of bitch niggas
I'm goin' down a list nigga
We stole a lot of base, yeah-yeah
We got a lot of hits, nigga
Alright, we don't fuck with switch hittas
Throw 'em in a river, let the fish get 'em
I'm comin' with the street sweeper
Like a motherfuckin' witch nigga
Like, what nigga, which nigga
Like, a young nigga, rich nigga
Like cremate or coffin
Or motherfuckin' ditch, nigga? Ugh
You might also like
You left a trace, now my niggas all up in your place
Now it ain't no money in the safe
Got to do a nigga like Ace
Yeah, go ahead get a plastic bag
Keep your fake jewelry, I need all the cash
Like you shaved your face, go up in your stash
I get stomach aches, throw up in the lab
Got a plastic bag, fuck navigation
Nigga, we a sack
No Ceilings Dos, this is that
Yeah, I hear 'em talkin', talkin' this and that
I'm still in the mall, buyin' this and that
And my bitch stay with a different bag
Yeah, I'm in my zone in a different bag
They'll find your body parts in different bags
Hold up
Before rap they was check to check
We was pack to pack
And my girl was blonde now she back to black
We in the Benz bumpin Back To Back
Smokin' loud, poppin' pills, back to back
And I'mma fuck her from the back after that
She hit the bathroom then pass a rag
And to the money, yeah I'm back to that
Yeah, Young Money over everything
And I mean everything, that's on everything
Niggas get caught and tell everything
With the Weeknd vocals, I'll never sing
Yeah, two words, on sight nigga
I push the button, green light nigga
To the upper room, here's your flight nigga
Even if it's morning, good night, nigga
Blaow
Get a plastic bag
Throw it over his head, make him gag
Go 'head take the nigga's stash
And the money danced all night nigga, you deserved it
Get a plastic bag
Throw it over his head, make him gag
Throw it over his head, make him gag
Nigga, you dabbed all night nigga, stop twerkin'
Aww yeah, aww yeah
You put on a show all night, now it's curtains, yeah
Two words, on sight
