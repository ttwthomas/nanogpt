Surf Club, Young Money
Young Money Surf Club

This is for them girls
Mashin off in they own whip
Pullin up to they own shit
All they needed is long dick
I'm a show why they call me here for real
Cause I hit it out the park
Like a little league field
It's easy believe me
And I ain't even talking greazy
I back it up
So all you got to do is back it up
And you will love it
Cause you fuckin with the surf
Let me show you what them other niggas worth
That's nothing

You know they gon fall
Ain't no compe-
Tition ain't no composition
Tell me your position
Which one do you enter?
Enter
Then I send you home to your nigga
Girl I know you wanna see the mansion
So don't act like you don't
And you know you goin down for sure
So don't act like you won't
You might also like
And I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryna hit it hit it like I can't miss
Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryna hit it hit it like I can't miss
And I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryna hit it hit it like I can't miss
Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryna hit it hit it like I can't

Think about it daily
Your pussy nice and wet
Me hittin you
You bent over your legs up in my chest
You say you got that best
Well let me find out
Lemme lay on my back
You get on top and just grind out
Then me and you grind
Out
Close the blinds
Down
Oh so you like em open
I see you clear in focus
Now watch me bust it open
I'm all up in your ocean
Your pussy glistenin' like you got on some dolphin lotion
Now I know this for a fact
You want me up in that
Beat it up
Treat that pussy cat just like a punchin bag
Eat it up
Treat that pussy cat just like my favorite snack
I want it all
Just like I'm at the mall
And I'm about to ball witchu
So girl let me get you to the surf club
And we can do all of the things you never heard of
So keep your lips sealed and thighs open
I'll fill your ocean up with my motion

And I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryna hit it hit it like I can't miss
Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryna hit it hit it like I can't miss
And I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryna hit it hit it like I can't miss
Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryna hit it hit it like I can't

Uh uh uh uh uhhhhhhh

Ok now shawty take your clothes off
And I'm a hit it I'm a hit it til we doze off
And when we wake up I'm a hit it til we doze off
She say her pussy is poppin
I'm like if that's the case I'm a beat it like johnny cochran

Ain't nuttin between me and you
But this bikini
Now can I take it off ya
Rub my tongue across ya

But I am just the carter

Straight to the carter
Yea that's where I brought her
And I swear I'm a make her cheer like victory
Shawy shawty you can be a spear like britt-an-y
Literally
And I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryna hit it hit it like I can't miss
Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryna hit it hit it like I can't missEmbed
