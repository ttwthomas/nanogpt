59 ContributorsTwist Made Me (Sure Thing) Lyrics
Ugh!
Twist made me do this
Paw-Paw in here with me, T in here with me
Ugh

Kush in the Swisher, money over bitches
Never kill a woman, unless she a witness
All about my business, survival of the fittest
She let me hide my weed in her titties
Bitch, I got the cash, in a rubberband
I got the Glock, already cocked, boom!
Fucking with a nigga, meet my motherfucking goons
Sorry 4 the Wait, Carter IV coming soon
Light it up, cause I’ma smoker
She tried to deepthroat, I fucked around and choked her
It’s Young Money, motherfucker, game over
Shots leave your body, looking like you doing yoga
And Lord knows I'm a sinner, pain pills for dinner
Bitch, I'm getting money like I got a money printer
Got a chopper and a trimmer, shooting like Jimmer
You coming in that water, boy, you better be a swimmer
I ain't worrying bout y’all, sitting on my Hog
While Miss Anita Baker sing "You Bringing Me Joy"
I came straight outta jail and did my thing on these boys
And we all yelled, “Fuck you, bitch!” and kept going
I'm on, and that’s right, baby
I ain't going out this bitch without a fight, baby
One request: please don’t bite, baby
I got some bomb-ass pussy from a white lady
I ain't lying, I’ma shine like a nickel or a diamond
I smoke a lot of weed to keep them bitches off of my mind
Girl, stop talking that shit
Go on and suck a nigga dick for a new outfit, hahaha
And even if the sky come falling
Bitch, I’ma still be high
I got faith in my weedman
My lil niggas got yay' by the beanbag
Hit your ass from the side like a screen pass
And that red bandana is the team flag
Yeah, all up in your fucking face
Tez pushed the album back; sorry for the wait
You might also like
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
