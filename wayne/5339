49 ContributorsKnuck If You Buck Lyrics
Young Maine for President
I'll probably paint the White House black if it was my residence
Bush back in office, some niggas feel that's irrelevant
Cause they still pedalin' this medicine, but anyway, anyday
I can zurk off quick and make my semi spray
Send some of my men away just to blow your men away
Stephon Marbury type bullets, they like the penetrate
Young Money, we outta school, but we got chemistry
Young Spitta, Young Maine, Young Cop, Young Mobb, Tez Poe
We don't pass the rock nigga, we ball hog
Mad slow in the Escalade nigga, y'all all fall
Jack your fresh ass Caddy and steal your white walls
Nigga, we don't like y'all
Hell yeah, we will fight y'all
We ain't on no Tyson shit
We ain't tryna' bite y'all
Knuckin' if you buckin', probably bustin' at your cousin
How youngins' that spout something
Y'all niggas ain't 'bout nothin'

Nigga we bussin', and bussin', to the bang of buss
No, we don't run for the Olympics, but the flame with us
I got that tussin', that scummy, and that angel dust
So pick your high, I will supply and correct changes, what's up
We bring the bussin', we bussin' like this thang for us
You niggas is sleeveless man, you can't hang with us
I got a bitch who speak Spanglish
She keep her bangles danglin'
And the cocaine is right up in her anus
Old Wayne is right up in the spot where he supposed to
Be, got Hova at the game and now he coachin'
Me, but I've been the champion, happy as I ever been
Lampin' in the Hamptons like, what the fuck is a hammock
The chef up in the kitchen like, what the fuck is a sammich
I'm like, we gotta find middle ground, we need balance
Challenge me, that be to my advantage
I'm outstanding, like standing outside up in the twister and walking not damaged
Standing outside up in the blizzard and walking hot handed
Serving nicklebags in Iraq, bet I will not panic
Swerve the nickel black, if I wreck, bet I will not panic
Cop another one the next day and drive it crazier
The seats will be lazier, shit'll be gravier
Nina Sarafeena my girl, so then I baby her
Wavin' at her at two crazy, Fugazis, I'm too brazen, three brazees deep
We got .380s and P80
.99s, M-10s and M1s and 12 gauges
Shell cases, money put up for jail cases, bail make it
My momma say, tuck your chain son, they'll take it
I hit her with one of them stale faces, like
I'll be damned momma, they know who I am momma
I'm still your little boy, but to them, I'm the man momma
Fuck with your boy, man Hollygrove the hood, nigga
Throw it in your face 'til you get that understood
You might also like
Niggas know I'm heavy with the coke, with the coke
In the Impala SS and sittin' heavy on the spokes
Never am I broke man, I'm playin with some change
I get a nigga soaked like he playing in the rain
And everywhere I go, a ho starin' at my chain
I'm the most valuable player in the game
All these haters wanna ride me
Cause I got more kicks than niggas with black belts in karate
Keep a redbone with a real nice body
Just copped a 'Lac and a yellow Maserati
Niggas ain't fuckin with the dawg
When Young Money shoppin', we don't leave nothing in the mall
These niggas ain't as rich as us
Man your rims too small, get your motherfucking inches up
Cause I copped me a Benz today
Just to go on 106 & Park and hand the keys over to Free and AJ
