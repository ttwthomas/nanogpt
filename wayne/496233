Think about Lil Tune, I'm just hoping that it's good thoughts
Yeah, entertainment sports on your network
I love top 10 plays, yessir, best work
Live on TV, mama told me wear a dress shirt
Instead I wore a t-shirt, Michael Jordan sneakers
Red Sox ballcap my dreadlocks fall back
I still think I'm fly, show me where the tarmac
They say I'm taking over, I'm like where do I start at
Green Bay Packer but New Orleans where my heart at
LA Laker fan, let's give Drake a hand
For costing the Toronto Raptors 25 grand, I'm goneYou might also like16Embed
