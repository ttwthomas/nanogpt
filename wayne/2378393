35 ContributorsBig Wings Lyrics
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Fuck with me wrong and get hit up
We hit every block and we hit all your men up
She do every squat and she do every sit up
She dance everyday and she pick every bit up
I work everyday and I sip when I get up
You heard what I say, yeah I sip when I get up
And work everyday, I'm a hell of a nigga
Smokin' that loud, it just yell at a nigga
Confidence high, I'm a arrogant nigga
These bitches do not want a regular nigga
My slime got them bricks doing estimates, nigga
That's numbers and squares like a calendar, nigga
That's numbers and squares like a calendar, nigga
None of you squares wanna battle lil nigga
Cause shots come from nowhere like, Bop!
Abracadabra, nigga
Hold up

I fuck a clit up on everything
I put some sip up in everything
You hit your bitch up, she never came
She was with me up in Neverland
I hit your clique up and everything
I take two clips up in everything
I'm coming, I'm shooting up everything
I just bought my woman some Vera Wang
I just bought myself Alexander Wang
I just bought myself some new Louis frames
I got 'em prescribed cause I'm blind as fuck
Or is it that I just don't wanna see you again?
Got 'em prescribed
I got a prescription
I got a prescription
I got a prescription...
I fuck a clit up on everything
Tie my bitch up to the bed frame
22.5 for the Venus
11 flat for the Serena
Drink codeine like it's Aquafina
My bitch jalapena
I come from Mars, I come from Ms. Cita
Fresh out the womb I knew I was a leader
Who keeping score 'cause I beat 'em
You might also like
And I got some really big wings
Flying over New Orleans
I pull some really big strings
My wingspan like Yao Ming
My eyes tight like Yao Ming
I smoke some really big greens
I sip the whole sixteen
I saw a mill' at fifteen
And still got really big dreams
Your bitch a really big fiend
Your bitch a really big fan
But I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no ceilings
I ain't got no ceilings

Man, what a high
Born to be alive
I'm sippin' lean
And TMZ said I died (damn)
I run with bitch-slappers
Your hate don't impact us
Our bitches' dick-grabbers
Your bitches' pic-snappers
You just a camera rapper
But we don't point cameras at you
We point them hammers at you
More bullets than hammer dancers
We take the pineapple
And we fill it with purple, we never settle
We take the Mac-11
We point that bitch straight at your cerebellum
Bah!
Yeah, and this world is mines
Yeah, I'm gettin' mines
Yeah, I'm sippin' lines
Sippin', oh we talkin' lean?
Oh, we talkin' lean?!
Oh, you pourin' up?
Finna fall asleep?!
Look at the smile on me
Spent a couple hundred thou' on it
And the game been drove me crazy
Over hundred thousand miles on me
Damn, said she gonna lie for me
I said you just lied to me
She tell me that's my pussy
I say bitch you just lied to me
That's why I fuck 'em all
Still love 'em all
With a rubber off
Cause they husbands' dogs
And to top it off
All the tops is off
And it's winter season
But the seats is heated

And I got some really big wings
I got a really big regime
Been part of some really big schemes
I just popped a really big bean
I just popped a really big bean
I rock some really big bling
I sleep on a really big king
With a really thick queen
I sleep with a really thick queen
On a really big king
She belt out really big screams
She say I got a really big ting
She say I'm doing really big things
I should be doing really big scenes
On a really big screen
You see, I got really big dreams
And what a grind...
I fuck a clit up on everything
I put some sip up in everything
I put some sip up in everything
I put some sip up in everything
