28 ContributorsRunnin’ Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

The loser, microphone abuser
Feet hurtin', I just walked from Jerusalem
So you should get on the side with the movement
I'm the proof and I'll die just to prove it
What you wanna know? Anything, whatever
I can't tell you, I can show you better
Me-Me and my gun, we took an oath together
Said, "I will never die, if we both together"
Yeah, this is my testification
I'ma Wayne on their hands like precipitation
And in hell, you-you need justification
But-but for me, it was just a vacation
Heheheh, yeah

Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!
You might also like
I lost all my money, I lost half my mind
Can't find my direction, where's the finish line?
Could I be that far away from it all? How far to go?
If I can stay for it all, then I shouldn't fall

Uh, but if I fall, I fall up and let the clouds hug me
And if I fall down, I bet I hit the ground runnin'
Bet you search and found nothin', looking for the finish line
Stop short cuttin', you fuckin' up your finish time
Shit, but every twice in a while
It feels like I'm runnin', and life is the miles
Yeah, but until the lights dimmin' down
I'll be runnin' 'round, runnin', runnin'
Oh, oh-woah, will you tell me?

Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!
Counting all my pennies, but it doesn't add up
At the mercy, but somehow it ain't enough
Reading all the red lights, trying not to give up
But I don't know how long it's gonna last, oh
It's almost over now
I say it's almost over now
The end is gettin' closer now
Better do what you supposed to 'cause the world is oh-so short now

Somebody tell me when's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', run it all
When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end up?
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Run it all!

When's it gonna end?
Where's it gonna end?
Runnin', run it all
Yeah! I'm runnin' out of time, I'm runnin' out of space
Feel like I'm runnin' 'round, but I'm runnin' in place
We all in the race, I'm just another sprinter
If there's no finish line, then who's the real winner?4Embed
