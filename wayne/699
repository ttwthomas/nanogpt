Okay
Gangsta Gri-Zillz!

Now, put lil' Mack on the map if he walk it off (Shout-out the East Bank! Shout-out the West Bank!)
Now, put lil' Spitta on the map if he walk it off (This how it supposed to sound)
Now, put lil' Po on the map if he walk it off
Say, put lil' Fee on the map if he walk it off (Gangsta! Ill!)
Say, put E.I. on the map if he walk it off
'Kay, put lil' Drew on the map if he walk it off (Taz, what up?)
Say, put lil' Marc on the map if he walk it off
I'm a— (Gangsta!), I'm a— (Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!)

I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to stunt
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to stunt
Bitch, I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to front
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to front
Ho, I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't lyin' to you
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't lyin' to you
You might see me in a Bentley painted royal blue
With the white interior on a set of twenty-twos
You might also like
I'm a jalape-nuh, boy, hot as Cayenne pepper
I'm from New Orleans City, but I take her to wherever
I'm tougher than leather, I'm smoother than suede
Always never broke, ‘cause I'm usually paid
Got the Rover with the cage—kinda brown, off-beige
Everybody look at me, like I'm riding on stage
Got a woman named Sage—she twice my age
Every time she hit me up, she send a picture with a page
I ain't tryna fall in love, I ain't tryna get engaged
You can meet me at the alter when a nigga really dead
Every time I'm tryna leave, she beggin’ me to stay
And I politely fade away, like my name was MJ
Then, she wrote me a note—guess what that note says?
"Wayne, I hope you still like me, but I go both ways"
And then, I said, "Oh"; then I said, "Okay"
Stabbed 'em up and got the fuck, like my name was OJ
If you lookin’ for some money, bitch, my name is "No Way"
Not tomorrow, not today, not yesterday
I'm Mr. President, as they say
And that Phantom fits me, like it’s tailor-made
I can take them to war, nigga—bombs away
I been in the water, fucking on the marmalades
If you lookin’ for some money, bitch, my name is "No Way"
Not tomorrow, not today, not yesterday
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to stunt
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to stunt
Bitch, I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to front
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to front
Ho, I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't lyin' to you
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't lyin' to you
You might see me in a Bentley painted royal blue
With the white interior, on a set of twenty-twos (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

Last week, I met a bitch, but I forgot her name
Short, sweet, red, cute—ol' vivrant thing
She got a earring in her pussy and everywhere else
She said she jog every day so she could cum on herself
Then, she tell me my love is the best she's felt
And she suck my dick like it’s about to melt
She drink Vitamin Water—say it’s good for her health
She can wrap my whole dick around her waist, like a belt
Then, here’s another bitch—her name was Ayesha
She ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza
One time, it was so good, I told her, "Order one more"
She said, "It’s not Domino's—it's DiGiornos"
There’s another bitch—I met her at The Gong Show
Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show
She do my dishes, wash my clothes, and fix my cornrows
She do my dishes, wash my clothes, and fix my cornrows
I can't forget about my bitch named Meaty Boo
She’s a young project bitch—I used to bring that ho to school
So, I brought the ho to the school; we standing on the yard
A bitch asked me—was I from the 17th Ward?
Niggas came out the cut and started muggin’ me up
I grabbed the clip out my pocket and made them cowards duck
Then, I told my old lady, "I’ll be back, you see
And hit me on my cell phone if niggas lookin’ for me"
'Cause I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to stunt
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to stunt
Bitch, I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to front
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't tryin' to front
Ho, I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't lyin' to you
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't lyin' to you
You might see me in a Bentley painted royal blue
With the white interior, on a set of twenty-twos

Now, shake, slide ride, twerk, jerk, giddy-up
Jump, bounce on the dick, and get the fuck— get the fuck— yeah!
Shake, slide, ride, twerk, jerk, giddy-up
Jump, bounce on the dick, and get the fuck— get the fuck—
My name is Lil Weezy; they say I'm off the heezy
And I tell a dog ho, "Don't— Don't you be greedy"
My name is Lil Weezy; they say I'm off the heezy
And I tell a dog ho, "Don't— Don’t you be greedy
Don’t— Don't you be greedy— don’t— don't you be greedy, bitch
Don't you be greedy— don’t— don't you be greedy"
‘Cause it'll "rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat" on them dog hoes
It'll "rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat" on them dog hoes

Ho, I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't lyin' to you
I'm a good-lookin' rapper, I ain't lyin' to you
