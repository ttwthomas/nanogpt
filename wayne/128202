26 ContributorsCommas Lyrics
I need commas after my commas, commas after my commas
I need commas after my commas, commas after my commas
I need commas after my commas, commas after my commas, money
We ain’t talking no bands nigga, we ain’t talking no bands nigga
We ain’t talking no bands nigga, we ain’t talking no bands nigga
I need commas after my commas, commas after my commas, money
I need commas after my commas, commas after my commas
We ain’t talking no bands nigga, we ain’t talking no bands nigga
We ain’t talking no bands nigga, we ain’t talking no bands

I got polo on my body, but I’m talking ferarri
White girl in the party, mary jane won’t you meet molly
Couldn’t feel no better, hunned thous on my sweater
Niggas say they cold, just a little bit under the weather
I mean, you done shits y’all leathers, get your shit together
I gave you niggas some time, now I got a vendetta
Damn niggas is basic, with the chapagne imported
Possoms get arranged and then they get recorded
See them diamonds they dance nigga, fucking up your plans nigga
Feel like David Ruffin, cause we ain’t talking no bands nigga


Pussy nigga I hope you loosin sleep
That old money still new to me
I take a shower with a sexy broad
I put a thousand on a debit card
Birdman, let me hold a million bucks
He gave it to me, didn’t even asked for what
Yeah, that’s how we do ymcmb, yeah
Checkin niggas like an ID
Commas after my commas, try me nigga that’s trauma
Find pussy hairs in my vomit
I’m the don not Imus, me and them broke niggas
We ain’t got nothing in common
I promise I’ll never go broke, and never break that promise

I’m in the hood on defense, my range rover is a v10
Locked up in this county jail, can't post bail cuz it's the weekend
Got a pretty lil redbone, I can’t wait to sink my teeth in
You got guns, we got guns, fuck it nigga, it’s beef then
Yeah boy I got young mula, keep a couple them young shooters
We the one we aiming them choppers at
My pockets fat like the young Luther
Can’t afford this jewelry, put their chains towards gratuity
Yeah these bitches know I’m checkin bags
Like airport security
I got commas after commas, all in that order
While you niggas chasing bands like concert promoters
