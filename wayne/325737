7 ContributorsI Got That Gangsta Lyrics
The affiliates nigga holla atcha boy

If you looking for some coke I'm your supplier
No TV my life like The Wire
Everything I say from what I did prior
Real street nigga I'm the one they admire
Niggas ain't Gs they motherfucking liars
The industry full of fruits like papaya
Shoot em in they neck and they back like Khia
I roll like a Michelin tire
I annihilate those who perpetrate
I squeeze, I don't hesitate
The four-five will set a crooked nigga straight
You hate, I participate
O '10 Benz with the temporary plates
Rolling to the club, about to find me a date
Shit is simple, it ain't rocket science
Grand Daddy Purp, know I get the highest
Embassy jean jackets know I'm the flyest
Anybody can bite the bullet, I ain't biased
I get it in, my connect Mexican
Prices so low, it's a win-win

Who got who got some gangsta shit
Who got who got some gangsta shit
I said I got I got some gangsta shit
AMG Embassy them gangsta hits
Who got who got some gangsta shit
Who got who got some gangsta shit
I said I got I got some gangsta shit
AMG Embassy them gangsta hits

Ayo it's Willie
It's royal flyness your majesty
Niggas where I'm from only understand savagery
Casualties bound to happen over cash actually
Or perhaps a nigga just jealous, it baffle me
It's Willie
It's royal flyness your majesty
Niggas where I'm from only understand savagery
Casualties bound to happen over cash actually
Or perhaps a nigga just jealous, it baffle me
So, get shot, quick fast on the double
This black 40 Glock inside my Moncler bubble
More money, more trouble
Never meddle with the rubble
I ball never double
Get the drawers never cuddle
I play my cards right
Caught a play inside the huddle
Caught inside the shuffle trying to muffle the rebuttal
Niggas don't bite they just barkin' through the muzzle
Everything in moderation I prefer to keep it subtle
I know Young LA, the real Young LA
Willie the Kid, I'm going hard doing 2 a days
Anyway, nigga understand my vision
On a boat Lake Michigan a couple chicks fishin'
Who got who got some gangsta shit
Who got who got some gangsta shit
I said I got I got some gangsta shit
AMG Embassy them gangsta hits
Who got who got some gangsta shit
Who got who got some gangsta shit
I said I got I got some gangsta shit
AMG Embassy them gangsta hits

Gangsta Grillz you bastardsEmbed
