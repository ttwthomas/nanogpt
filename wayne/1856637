Turn around back it up now catch the ball
Wrooof!

And let it fall slow
Little nigga foot in that pussy
I stand tall 
And tell ya man I beat up niggas like hard pool
Ya seen "The Color Purple"
And we don't smoke dat green
We smoke the color purple
Yah!

And we're not gonna stop just because
The feds and the cops are watching us
See we don't give a damn wat they say
We do wat we want to
Young money mu'thafucka
Got them hoes watching us
I say my niggas high
I like to fuck
And I can look dead in her face
And see that she wants to

And I skin milked the paint to make it look like coffin

Vultures I dun told cha
How to roll up

20's on my coupe and 26's on my Rover
(26's on my Rover bitch!)
Money in my pocket and patron in my cup
(alright ah yah yah yah)
N I got bitches on my dick n I got bitches on my nuts
(we ain't neva lost)
Natural born hustler
Scisty individual
Play wit my bread
Shit'll end up critical
I ain't just start spittin flame
Boo been a fool

Pool in the living room
Unstackable roof
Mayback coupe

Bitch, bitch get off me
She wanna feel this niggas love I say
Give me time baby

Like bitch get off me
Bitch, bitch get off me

They say what goes up must come down
When I'm high as a muthafucka right now
Give me a favor, lay a layer of pillows on the ground
Run around in a pair of shoes so fly
And a box came wit a paricuit no lie
Spitta nigga I be insight for so eyes
Spitta nigga I'm a delight to ya whole eyes
Neva give a bitch to a bitch
Wounderful mind

And we're not gonna stop just because
The feds and the cops are watching us
See we don't give a damn wat they say
We do wat we want to
Young money mu'thafucka
Got them hoes watching us
I say my niggas high
I like to fuck
And I can look dead in her face
And see that she wants to

Give me time baby
Just give me space
I don't want u around
Like bitch get off me
Bitch, bitch get off me
She wanna feel this niggas love I say
Give me time baby
Just give me space
