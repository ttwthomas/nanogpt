14 ContributorsViva La White Girl (Remix) Lyrics
(Fame, fortune, platinum records
It's every boy's dream.)
Yeah, just breathe baby
Gym Class Heroes
Ya'll Money
Weezy Baby Ya'll
*Laugh*

Yipe Yo Ki Yah, Gitty up
As the white stallion bucks
And kicks me in my nose until my face bust, fuck
And they say that they can keep the pace up, but its
Clear as a mirror they don't want to race us
As I stare in this mirror and powder my face up
And I never ever been one to make up
Any allegations that alligators ate us
And from the spine I spit shots, you gonna need 8 cups
Game and money, call me Mr. Monopolist
Ms. Aphrodite what is your synopsis
You can be the goddess of my white castle
Reach me on the hotline and burn your nostrils
Professor cool, I bring class to gym
And since I am the hero I must save them
Him is I and I is Wayne
This isn't your brain on drugs; its drugs from the brain
You might also like
Let's go
The world is yours, so play the role
Blow the dust off this record and put the needle down slow
Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old
Let's have a toast, and raise our drinks
No hearts on our sleeves, just eagles on our cuff links
It's such a rush to know you love me so much

We'll do whatever you want to
Girl I'll make a movie star of you
You know that I could
If you let me be your Hollywood

We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
Take your razor, break down my line
Put your nose to the speaker
Now breathe in, breathe in
Clean up your nose, and face the crowd
Then kiss your mirror cause we're all stars now
Isn't it fun how music makes your lips numb?





Breathe in. (x4)1Embed
