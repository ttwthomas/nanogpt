17 ContributorsNeva Get Enuf Lyrics
3L and Wayne, what up

Listen, I'm way better than that chump, yeah
Sorry cause I let her get her stuff
Cause she shiftin' with a brother
Who could never get enough of her
I'd go tough for her, could never do enough for her
Mad love for her, mad thoughts of her
Days and days again
And I'm like Rocky, where's my Adrienne
Now, holler back, Kiely
Sweethearts, bounce if you feel me
Little women love little me
Never get enough

Why
Every time I meet a guy
Who wants to try
To get my mathematics
I deny
He wants to take me home
He's out of his mind (Get your mind right)
Will I ever meet someone for me
You might also like
He's gotta be the one that I'm
Daydreaming to spend my time with
He's gotta be the one with no
Chicks attached then that's my man

To all my girls
That dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout
The ones that makes
Us cling to the thoughts of love
And he's so fresh, he's so clean (So fresh, so clean)
Plus, I call and he calls me too (Okay)
That's why he's bad, my place
His pad, I could never get enough

I
I'm so glad I came across
This kind of guy
He didn't ask me for my number
I thought why
Then when I got the chance to know
He's gentle inside
Now, he's the one that's got me open wide
He's gotta be the one that I'm (Oh)
Daydreaming to spend my time with (With)
He's gotta be the one with no
Chicks attached then that's my man (With no chicks attached then that's just my man)

To all my girls (My girls)
That dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout (What I'm talkin' 'bout)
The ones that makes
Us cling to the thoughts of love (Cling, oh yeah)
And he's so fresh, he's so clean
Plus, I call and he calls me too (And he calls me too)
That's why he's bad, my place (My place, his pad)
His pad, I could never get enough (Presidential Campaign)

Hey ma, I stop to holler not to bother, if you busy (Oh)
I'll wait out for hours, I'ma stick my wait out
All the way out for hours, what you know 'bout bein'
Hot for hours and not from showers, shh
Not yet though, how 'bout some flowers
How 'bout we hop out the wild one, knock out some lobster
I could make your problems easy, stop jabbin' and slabbin'
Weezy never get enough (To all my girls)
All my girls
That dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout (Know what I'm talkin' 'bout)
The ones that makes
Us cling to the thoughts of love (Cling to the thoughts of love)
And he's so fresh, he's so clean (Yeah)
Plus, I call and he calls me too (When I call, he calls me too)
That's why he's bad, my place (Oh)
His pad, I could never get enough
To all my girls (To all)
That dream know what I'm talkin' 'bout (Know just what I'm talkin' 'bout)
The ones that makes (Yeah)
Us cling to the thoughts of love (That's why he's bad, my place)
And he's so fresh, he's so clean (Oh)
Plus, I call and he calls me too
That's why he's bad, my place
His pad, I could never get enough

(That's right) Epic
Weezy, baby
