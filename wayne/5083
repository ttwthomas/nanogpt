50 ContributorsHit Em Up Lyrics
Yeah
I tried talk to 'em

Quit talkin', I'ma hang you by your tongue, yeah
Any motormouth could get hung high
We don't fuck with niggas like fungi, we don't even hear ya
Hollerin' bullshit, nigga, cut the diarrhea (Get 'em)
Pistol lie inside of the armrest (Yeah), um, yes
Lay a nigga down in his own mess (Yeah), don't mess
Player fuck around with the homeless (Yeah), charmless
You can leave out here armless, no homies (Go)
Honest, you niggas is harmless
I'm calm as a don is supposed to (Be), Cosa Nostra
Don't ever approach him (Nah), don't get close to him (Uh-uh)
Shootouts ain't nothin' but rock and roll to him (Damn)
Leave your blood on the dash', call it rosewood (Ugh)
'Nother murder, 'nother page out the notebook
It ain't nothing and don't make it if you no good
I tried talk to 'em, but then a nigga had to

Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em, but I hit 'em up
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em (Yo)

Take them shoes off your teeth, stop runnin' your mouth
No shoes, no feet, I'll run in your mouth (Huh)
I'll come to your house, me and my goons
Loadin' up bangers, ridin' under the moon (Yeah)
Throwing up fingers, saying, "My side rule" (Yeah)
If a nigga disagree, that's when my side prove (Get 'em), yeah
That Maybach coupe a cockeyed fool
And I'm in it like Bennett, ho, aren't I cool?
But if the thermostat switch and that needle move (Uh-oh)
Then the attitude switch and that heat'll move
I got that Chiquita banana clip for the tool
Meet a disaster, pity the fool
Eat a catastrophe, swallow the truth
Belch reality, how does it taste?
Powder your face, you a bitch, nigga
All pussy, stop comin' out your lips, nigga
I tried talk to 'em, but then a nigga had to

Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em, but I hit 'em up
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Real talk, boy, chill with the talk, boy (Yeah)
That Tommy gun'll tear your neighborhood apart, boy (Blatt)
Yeah, leave your feelings in your heart, boy
You start with the wrong boy, it end with a song, boy (Oh)
With your friends to carry you along
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone (Yeah)
Fuck the discussion, I ain't into it, boy
I just get to it, let's do it, rip through a boy (Bah)
Big Uzi, just shoot a boy (Brr)
I'm inside looking out, you just an intruder, boy (Get 'em)
You need sutures on your smoochers, boy, but
I tried talk to 'em, but then a nigga had to

Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em, but I hit 'em up
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em26Embed
