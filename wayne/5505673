8 ContributorsInstagram Song 8 (CWYN) Lyrics
I need a baby that gon' eat and leave the dishes out
And try to mix the cereal and burn the kitchen down
She be workin', she be twerkin' when she sittin' down
She like to purchase Venom Ranger with the Swiss accounts

Twenty-four golfin', 'bout to save the dolphins
When I die I'ma need the all-white coffin
Handshake the login, closet is a walk-in
Hit the silent auction, kick that jit for talkin'
Got a girl that work for NASA and she said I'm a star
Got a girlfriend that's a rapper and she set up this bar
Got a model, she don't say shit, she just sat on my car
I try to leave her but I didn't get far, a stupid joke
I know the pimpin' business like that nigga Bubba do the shrimpin' business
We doin' fitness, bitch, my bedroom sound like women's tennis
And it was necessary, that shit hereditary
If I ain't really your daddy, talk to my secretary
Big Chano, smokin' cigarettes inside a grocery store
I got the sauce, I got the clout, I master Roshi flow
I watch 'em closely, can't be turnin' my back
I make 'em line up, take three times like my hat

Ooh, girl, I love you so
Told myself not to love these hoes
Told myself not to fall for these bitches
But it's hard to stop fallin' when you trippin' though
I'm pimpin', though, and pimpin' ain't easy, but it's necessary
I could feed eyes to a vegetarian
My main bitch said she feelin' secondary
Love you, worry 'bout yourself and not the other bitch I'm tellin', girl
I really wake up in the mornin', look up in the mirror at Wayne
Told 'em, must've haven't met another Tunechi yet
Man, hoppin' off the private plane, lookin' for the doja
I could choose to be a lotta things, I chose to be the chosen
Ain't no simpin', not on this side
Try too hard or quit tryin'
She can't let me go, I'm like a zipline
I told that ho, "If you gon' be a ho, you better be a good ho
Be the best ho you could be, go get the bread 'fore it's toast"
Boy, I fucked all of your hoes, you be spiralin' your hoes
And if pimpin' is dead, I hope she ain't scared of ghosts
I said, "Pimpin' ain't easy, but it's necessary"
And bitch, if you gon' leave, you should've left already
Tunechi

When you was ridin' around your town with your ho, bad
I was puttin' diamonds on the sides of my Dolces
When you was ridin' (Huh, huh)
When you was ridin' (You been ridin')
When you was ridin' around your town with your ho, bad (What?)
I was puttin' diamonds on the sides of my Dolces
When you was ridin' (Huh)
When you was ridin'

Do that ragtag on my dick (Ah, ah)
Got my shit imported to Dubai for a key (Ah, ah)
Twenty rings on my muhfuckin' fist (Ah, ah)
Put my thumb in her butt, so I guess she got ice on her shit, a-ha (Ah, ah)
Twenty bitches out in that car like Big K.R.I.T. (Ah, ah)
I told Chance the Rapper to put some threes on my motherfuckin' kids (Ah, ah)
Fed 'em to the snake 'cause he was mothafuckin' snitchin' (Ah, ah)
These is with long shoestrings, it's only time I'm trippin' (Drops mic, hol' on, hol' on, hol' on)
This a historical moment
That was a wrapper, and whoever want it
I'm at the top, I'm all alone, Macaulay Culkin
I got a tall Brazilian bitch, I'm ridin' like ponies
I don't know 'bout you, but only police is my opponents
I'm 'bout to put it to his head like Stoney
You might as well put some colorful clothes on, yeah
'Cause the only thing we know you from is clonin'
If it got somethin' to do with sellin' pussy, we condone it
She gon' throw it back, ping-pong it
Sellin' bitches dreams, yeah, I'm ownin' it
Never keep it real with a ultimate
Only you know how far this could go
You knew
Stepped on a four leaf clover and I got paid like I was drunk and sober
But you knew
I need a baby that gon' eat and leave the dishes out
And try to mix the cereal and burn the kitchen down
She be workin', she be twerkin' when she sittin' down
She like to purchase Venom Ranger with the Swiss accounts2Embed
