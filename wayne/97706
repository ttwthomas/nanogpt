I can't feel my face the ablum
Now watch me put dis beat 2 sleep like a valium
Neva mind me I just are who I are
A flat footed niga dat walk what he talk
Off 2 da bar pop a few bottles
Straight up out dat water wit my mark jacob goggles
And I go hard like a brett favre spiral
Bytchs n they draws and niggas in denial
Hollagrove harlem pump up the volume
David banner beat bytch butt like a stallion
Touch my medallion and meet my berretta
Leaving you lookin like a burger wit extra ketchup
Now throw yo sets up
We fuck sets up
We pick shells up
You pick ya chest up
Im on my one two's like a push up
L's is filling like a cook up
(Julez Santana)
Money in the bank
Watcha think
Money in the pocket
Yea I got it
Bytches get plugged like sockets
I lauch slugs like rockets
5 4 3 2 1 bye kid
Living like a gangsta get it like a hustla
Ya girl friend backed up stick her wit da plumber
Baseball batter louisville slugger
I got enough cash to make it rain or thunder
Ice ticker homie betta b getting ya cash up
My wrist Antarctica my neck is Alaska
My pinky is the north pole call me Santa
I spit nicotine call me cancer

I really dont give a fuck about ya
Wat im saying is that a nigga would take yo heart out cha
And in the neighborhood my face is like a voucher
I swear I keep that gun on guard like a bouncer
A ounce of that kush I smoke that kush
And I run this muthafucker like reggie bush
New orleans crook
Give me wat I took
Me and my money
Thats a good bookEmbed
