10 ContributorsFires & Desires Lyrics
Ayy, fires
And desires, burn through the night
Burn through the night
Fires
And desires burn through the night
Burn through the night

Alright, well her clothes is on fire, the rose is on fire
The ladder is on fire, but still I climb higher
'Cause her love is what I need, we've been sippin' gasoline
We make love out in the open, we set fire to the trees
Now she callin' me some fireman (huh), I see what's going on
She givin' out fire dome, gotta turn on the sirens on
I walk through the steam for her, yeah she made me fiend for her
Now I'm 'bout to finish her, she need an extinguisher

Ayy, fires
And desires, burn through the night
Burn through the night
Fires
And desires burn through the night
Burn through the night

I turned her out, I got her cookin' hard
Fuck takin' pictures, take a bullet for us
I make her count the guap in just her draws
I make her count out loud, I listen hard
I brought her round too many strippers lord
She said fuck tippin' and start kissin' broads
I burnt her out, she need a break lord
I told her hold that tight, you get replaced lord
Ain't got a job, I make her look employed
I made her throw away her pussy toy
She got desire for a fire boy
And she ain't seen a fire higher lord

Ayy, fires
And desires burn through the night
Burn through the night
Fires
And desires burn through the night
Burn through the night5Embed
