1 ContributorI Can Only Imagine (Extended) Lyrics
Where you been? Where you been all my life?
Baby, it's a sin, the way you looking alive
It's obvious that I want something from you
And you know what
What I wanna do, do, do

If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like

Saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, "Wassup"
You can tell me your name, when we wakin' up
They, they call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody done gave Cupid a Uzi
Sh-Shoot me, you're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights, and give me that spark
You might also like
If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like

I want your love to touch me, one touch will feel free
(It would bring me to life)
I want to feel free, so I can finally be (If you kiss me)
So I can finally be, so I can finally be (Girl, give me now)
So I can finally see, so I can finally see (Give me now)

Saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, "Wassup"
You can tell me your name, when we wakin' up
They, they call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody done gave Cupid a Uzi
Sh-shoot me, you're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights, and give me that spark
What it'd be likeEmbed
