1 ContributorStudio Lyrics(Intro)
Haha, yeah
Young Weezy Baby
Come To Tell Ya'll Today About A Lil Problem I Be Having
Oh Man See It's Like When I'm Down In The Studio
When I'm Down
When I'm Down In The Studio
Doing She Don't Think It's What I'm Doing
When It's Her That I'd Rather Be Doing
(Hook 1-Lil Wayne)
But Right Now I'm In The Studio Making This Track
My Girl At Home All Over My Back
She Blowin’ Up My Phone
She Tells Me She's Alone
I Say I Won’t Be Long
Let Me Finish This Song
But Right Now I'm In The Studio Eating This Track
My Girl At Home Begging Me To Come Back
Okay I’m Coming Home
And When I Get Home
Girl I’m Gonna Kill It Like I’m Killing This Song
But Right Now I'm In The Studio
(Verse 1-Lil Wayne)
Man Just Record Me
And Even With An Equal Sign You Couldn’t Pause Me
Haha Yeah
This Is The Office
Come Be My Secretary
Baby This Is The Office
And My Office Hours Are 9-5
But You Can Be My 6-10
I'mma Say It Again
And My Office Hours Are 9-5
But You Can Be My 6-10
But Right Now I’m In The Studio
And Every Time I Try To Say That’s What I’m Doing
She Just Think It's An Excuse
And I’m Out Tryna Get Some New Pussy
I Tell Her I'mma Hustla Baby
And New Money Feels Better Than New Pussy
But Right Now I’m In The Studio
And Every Time I Try To Say That’s What I’m Doing
She Just Think It's An Excuse
And I’m Out Tryna Get Something New
Okay Honey I’m Home
And Yeah I’m Tired But If I Fall Asleep
Then Shawty Shawty Fall Asleep On You
You might also like(Hook 2-Lil Wayne)
It's Like When I'm Down In The Studio
When I'm Down In The Studio
But When I'm Down In The Studio Tryna Make A Track
My Girl Be At Home All Over My Back
And Every Time I Say That’s What I’m Doing
She Don't Think It's What I'm Doing
When It's Her That I'd Rather Be Doing
But Right Now I'm In The Studio Making This Track
My Girl At Home Begging Me To Come Back
Okay I’m Coming Home
And When I Get Home
Girl I’m Gonna Kill It Like I’m Killing This Song
But Right Now I'm In The Studio
(Verse 2-Mack Maine)
Man, Just Record Your Boy
If I Sound A Lil Pissed
Disregard Ya Boy
My Baby Girl Really Acting Like A Baby
Sending Text Stressed
Tryna Make It Hard For Ya Boy
I’m Like Shawty Better Use Your Toy
See A Nigga Never Absent
But I Might Be Tardy
Lordy, Lordy, I Likes To Party
See I Could Be With Two Freaks
About To Have An Orgy
Or I Could Be With Pamela
Could Be With Audrey
Instead I’m Telling The Engineer “Dude Just Record Me”
And As Soon As Angel Records Me
That’s More Gucci, More Prada, More Louie V
See Every Verse Bring Us Closer To Our Dream House
Now We Closer To The Things That We Dream ’Bout
And When I Get Home I Ain’t Tryna Go To Sleep
But If I Fall Asleep
Then Shawty Shawty Fall Asleep On You
Aye Why You Acting Like That
(Hook 3-Lil Wayne)
I say I’m Coming Back
And When I Get Back
I Told Her I'mma Eat It Like I’m Eating This Track
And She Came Down To The Studio When She Heard That
She Walked In To The Vocal Booth And Laid On Her Back
I Ain’t Even Start The Song
I Put My Face Where It Belong
And Then I Let Her Sing On My Private Microphone
It Went Down In The Studio Making This Track
Now Every Time She Hears It
It Make Her Think Back
Think Back To The Day
To The Day She Came To The Studio And Now
All She Ever Wanna Know Is If I’m Down In The StudioEmbed
