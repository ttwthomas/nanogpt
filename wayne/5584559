21 ContributorsS.O.T.L. (Silence of the Lambs) Lyrics
Here we go, Luda!

The world's screwed and niggas pourin’ drinks like Bill Huxtable (Ha)
I love R. Kelly but around my daughters, I'm not comfortable (Uh)
Stand for what you believe in like Kaepernick
You either in control or you gettin' fucked, no abstinence
Huh, it’s not enough blacks in the drivin' seat like a Nascar
Why? Cause most racist people still drinkin' what's at Roseanne's bar
Hah, Gandhi told me to be the change that I wanna see
But Mayweather told me blow my change on the shopping spree
What the world needs now (What's that?)
Is love sweet love (Is love sweet love)
But while the world takes its time
Can I get some drug sweet drugs? (Drug sweet drugs)
'Cause when you rich too rich, all you get is mug, mean mugs
And I'm gettin’ to that age, sweet age
I shouldn’t be up in the club, sweet club
Damn, grown shit, oldest daughter 'bout to go to college, nigga
Least I can do is leave her with a little knowledge, nigga
Yeah the clock’s tickin' but just know that all my music timeless, nigga
Ha, rap brought me back to restore a little bit of balance, nigga

Uh, goin' brazy in the Lamb
I don't give a damn, bitch fuck the ’Gram
Uh, pay these niggas no mind
Tried to pay attention, gotta underpay 'em
Damn, shit 'bout to get ugly
Like Shabba Ranks, Mr. Lover Man
Damn, anytime the GOAT speak
All the GOAT need is silence of the lambs, bitch
Any questions, any problems
We could talk about it or we could shoot shots, swish
If the message in the bottle too hard to swallow
We could do shots, bitch
Goin' brazy in the Lamb
I don't give a damn, bitch fuck the 'Gram
Uh, anytime the GOAT speak
All the GOAT need is silence of the lambs, bitch
See Ludacris LiveGet tickets as low as $37You might also like
Yeah, life's a test that X's all the losers from winners (Yeah)
Oh, watch me pass on that ass like Kendall Jenner (Woah)
Woah, they say between love and hate there's a thin line (Yeah)
I say love or hate, still no snitchin', that's a 6ix9ine (No)
.45 tucked away in the gut (Uh) ain't a killer but don't test me
'Cause if any nigga try to come at me or my family
Then the cops is gonna have to arrest me, catch me, fetch me
Niggas is wearin' a bulletproof vest just to go outside (Brr)
Innocent people are bystanders
Some are recordin' murders on they cameras or they on Live (Live)
Social media got kids wantin' to commit suicide (Damn)
'Cause everybody's gettin' scrutinized (Damn)
'Gram stuntin', those the truest lies
Now the parents need to be supervised
That's ass backwards
Bombs blowin' from the terrorist attackers (Woah)
Natural disasters, computer crashes (Woah)
World leaders clashin' (Ooh)
Separatin' us into different classes
Protect the elite and destroy the masses
So all up in the hood, it's pistols blastin'
No wonder why the hood gets not compassion
We don't have no shape, form or fashion
Feelin' like Mother Earth is mismatchin'
So we gotta hurry up and take some action
Or close your eyes and just imagine, damn
Uh, goin' brazy in the Lamb
I don't give a damn, bitch fuck the 'Gram
Uh, pay these niggas no mind
Tried to pay attention, gotta underpay 'em
Damn, shit 'bout to get ugly
Like Shabba Ranks, Mr. Lover Man
Damn, anytime the GOAT speak
All the GOAT need is silence of the lambs, bitch
Any questions, any problems
We could talk about it or we could shoot shots, swish
If the message in the bottle too hard to swallow
We could do shots, bitch
Goin' brazy in the Lamb
I don't give a damn, bitch fuck the 'Gram
Uh, anytime the GOAT speak
All the GOAT need is silence of the lambs, bitch2Embed
