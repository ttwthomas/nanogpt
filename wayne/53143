9 ContributorsThe Leak Lyrics
It's the microphone killa, microphone wrecker
Call me Mr. Twist himself, the young chubby checker like
Young money young'n, with no plane, ya boy
But a jet, and I am your favorite kid's choice award
No nick-at-night another year
And my girls know Miley Cyrus
But the money keep flowin' like a Jonas on the island
Jonas Brothers I'm so illy
Like the VIC, I'm so, so silly
Like I'm sittin' in the lab with Jae Millz, you gotta feel me, wait
Young mula baby, and yeah we so crazy
And I am so amazing and ya'll are so lazy
Call me Jeezy baby and please don't try to play me, yeah
You gon' need more than God to come save me, wait
That's my savior, church
Now I'm missin' ya
Eyes burnin' everyday, I'm sayin' like I'm mace-in ya
Then I hit the harlem shake, they like
"look Lil Twist you 'mazin now"
Then I hit the back space and now Lil Twist erasin' ya
Nah, I'm just show-casin' ya
If a test I'm acing ya
If you the young and I'm the cap
I can't belive no chasin ya
And with these jewels boy I can't feel my face
And I open up your top now the now the kid wastin ya
Intelligence the lil that you had
I'm the Big Bad Wolf's dad, homie no comparing me to no one
Especially you, I'm in the league next to you
Oh I bumped you, you boo times 2
And I'm ooo who weee
Awesome greatness, that's I
You can see me with no eyes, flyer than a bird's sight
No lie, why should I
I'm fly high like Jim Jones' song
We ballin when I was born to skip college
Straight running this game, no shame
You lame and rap should be my middle name
Lil Twist and Young Game, no Roc-a-fela ella
This rap game ain't easy
Oh wait it is easy when your big brother's WEEZY
GO!

Brand New money, br-brand new bostin'
And ya act brand new and get a brand new coffin
Lil bro I got ya hold ya weight and I'm a spot ya
All ya need is the combination to the locka
I'm the hip-hop rocka
I'm the hip-hop doctor
I'm in tip-top shape and my flip flops gucci
Drinkin Saki, eating sushi with a bunch of bad groupies
I swear I'm a walking movie, you ain't even gotta cue me
And baby I'm the shit you ain't even gotta do me
Cause ain't no one gon do me better than I'm a do me
So so I'm a do me
My watch say time to do me
You don't kick it like I kick it
Bitch I kick it, I'm kinda Bruce Lee
I'm the shooter behind the shooting I'm the looter behind the looting
And I got so much swagger I swear swagger tryin to sue me
Yo girlfriend trying to new me
I mean she trying to get to know me
She say that she will do all kinds of crazy shit to know me
Ok Lil Twist I'm Kobe, but I'm shooting like Ginobli
No one after, nor before me I go to Earth when Mars is boring
What am I worth? You can't afford me
But ya baby moms adore me
She wanna read my tattoos like a motherfuckin story
That's another fuckin story, well we get to that later
You don't know what you're in for, and call me Mr. Data
Or you can call me it's the greatest or for short just the greatest
I swear I walk right on the lot and bought the longest Mercedes
It's Weezy baby ho, turn up ya radio
I'm in the penthouse fucking on the patio
She call me daddy yo, she don't wear panty hose
And when I'm done watch out I do magic, make her vanish yo
But she was Spanish though, and I like them Spanish hoes
Yeah two of them and one of me's a Weezy sandwich ho
But I be like damn them hoes, I am an animal
I am the chief of the tribe like a Seminole
Crazy like Ann Nicole
But I'm expanding tho
Man I swear I don't need security, I need fan patrol
And I am Young Mula, and so is Twisty baby
And you ever forget that
And don't forget the baby, gone5Embed
