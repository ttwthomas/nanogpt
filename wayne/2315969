19 ContributorsLocked Away Again (The Remix) Lyrics

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
Right about now

Uh, I'm going away for a while
Pray for me child, would you wait for me now?
I know sometimes confusion can get weighed to the doubt
And sometimes I fall short of what I say I'm about, but
At my best I am love
And nothing comes easy but in God we trust
And she ride for me and I ride for us
She knew it be this way she said sign me up
And she lock it down when they lock me up
I knock it down she say knock me up
And when time get rough she take time adjust
And push come to shove she break down and puff
I can't say enough, can't make this up
Blood sweat and tears and love faith and luck
Sometimes we afraid, sometimes we are wrong
But with out being scared we don't get to be strong
(Love hard love long)

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?

Skiddly-down-down-down-dang
All I want is somebody real, who don't need much
A gal I know that I can trust
To be here when money low
If I did not have nothing else to give but love
Would that even be enough?
Girl me need to know
Aha

Now tell me would you really ride for me?
(would you really ride for me?)
Baby tell me would you die for me?
(tell me would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me? (what's up)
Would you be there to always hold me down?(aha aha)
Tell me would you really cry for me?
(would you really cry for me?)
Baby don't lie to me (baby don't lie to me)
If I didn't have anything (what's up)
I wanna know, would you stick around?
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?

Right about now
If a judge 'for life' me, would you stay by my side?
Or is you gonna say goodbye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life
Shawty, would it be alright?
Come on show me that you are down
Aha
Now tell me would you really ride for me?
(would you really ride for me?)
Baby tell me would you die for me?
(tell me would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me? (what's up)
Would you be there to always hold me down?(aha aha)
Tell me would you really cry for me?
(would you really cry for me?)
Baby don't lie to me (baby don't lie to me)
If I didn't have anything (what's up)
I wanna know, would you stick around?
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
