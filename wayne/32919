Cause my guru already laced it
Ain't no replacement

See this the south
Comin crunker than your average
Makes you wanna grab it
Cause you gotta have it
See Dawg Child will make it very spiced and Tasty
You really can't help but to move your body crazy
You feelin suntin and I know you jus can't help it
And I know what you're relievin
You might also like
Thats why
You'll never ever meet anotha playa
As fly
Thats the one with the dubbs on slant
Thats right
So pretty mama please dont let your chance
Pass by
Cause shawty you jus dont know

Have never ever met anotha girl
That fine
Starin so hard I didn't even see the
Stop sign
Hit the ground so hard made me

Once you get to know me

Bigger then a room
