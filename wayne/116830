You know
This just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?
This beat is so, so Metro
Young Mula, baby!

Ayy
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in a new 'Rari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean

Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a 'Vette
Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga, get back
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whip a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50 thousand on yo watch, young nigga, splurge
Pop a Ace of Spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin', gotta buss a cape
I'ma take a phone call, hustle every day
See Future LiveGet tickets as low as $70You might also like
Ayy
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in a new 'Rari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean

Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a Spyder
Young nigga play with keys like a typewriter
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a four-door Bimmer, driving with a rifle
Nigga, where you at? nigga, we gon' pull up on ya
Young bitch looking like Janet in the '80s
We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a Jheri curl
Got a styrofoam cup and it's full of syrup
Send it over from Lil' Mexico and let me work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt

Ayy
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'Rari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean
Pop a lot of pain pills
'Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels
Yeah
Beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
Yeah
Two cell phones ringin' at the same time
That's your ho callin' from two different phones
Tell that bitch, "Leave me the fuck alone!"
See, you fuck her wrong, and I fuck her long
I got a love-hate relationship with Molly
I'd rather pop a ollie and my dick is a trolley
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind
'Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man, I just received a package
Them other niggas taxin'
And my pockets so fat, I'm startin' to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home, man, that nigga must be snitchin'
Cut him off like karate

Ayy
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in a new 'Rari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean28Embed
