35 ContributorsPossessive Lyrics
When you love someone (Yeah), you can feel it in your bones
Try to do what he never did, set the tone
I remember we was at war when I slept alone
I wrote this shit for the most beautiful love that I ever known
I was tryna bag you, sendin' you signals like cellular phones
He tryna drag you, fucked up your feelings, left you alone
But are you braggin'? You found a nigga you can count on
Yeah, uh
I wonder, do your mama remember me?
She was talkin' down on me, switchin' your еnergies
I got you fallin' like wintеr leave perfect synergies

And I might get a little aggressive (Aggressive)
Yeah, I might get a little possessive
But you know I got good intentions (Ooh)
And even though you
Play it very cool
I know that you (Yeah, yeah, oh)

Uh, okay, this not a confession
I'm kinda possessive, your body impressive
Your time is too precious, I treat it like a diamond and bezel
I'm tryna Patek ya, ain't tryna let you out my protection
I'm tryna caress ya, these other niggas tryna correct ya
I'm tryna just let you be you, baby, I promise no pressure
I honor your presence, see you, act like I found me a treasure
And time is of essence, I want you to know mine is invested
In our connection, you interesting, I'm interested
I'm not with the flexin', especially when you out with your besties
I gotta respect it, I sit my ass down, let you check me
It's honestly sexy, you met me, I was not what expected
You mine until the end of time of possession

And I might get a little aggressive
Or I might get a little possessive
But you know I got good intention
Good intention
And even though you
You play it very cool
I know that you
I know you want it

I wouldn't do the same with them I do to you (I wouldn't)
How come everything I tell you end up in the news?
They won't love you when you're down and no answer
We gon' keep that between me, God, and you
Your temper
There's somethin' missin', baby, couple screws (Cuckoo)
The money ain't change a nigga, it's changin' you (Changin' you)
Parties be jumpin', but at the same time
I don't want it if it ain't you, oh, no
I repeat the same old patterns at night (Ooh)
That one moment that we shared, I want it in rewind
(Girl, I might get a little aggressive)
(And I might) Get a little too jealous
But you like when I drink from your water
Makin' me lose my mental when I see you (Psycho)
I never learn from it
I guess I love the burn from it (Yeah-yeah)
I guess this my turn, honey (Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
And I might get a little aggressive
Yeah, I might get a little possessive (Baby, baby)
But you know I got good intentions (I got, you and I, I, I)
And even though you
Play it very cool
I know that you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, got intentions1Embed
