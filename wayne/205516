Uh
Hello world I'm your
Motha fuckin troublemaker
Hello world I'm your
Motha fuckin troublemaker
I ain't no peacemaker
I'm a peace taker
I'm very destructive
Watch me break ya
Yeah, i love to smell that blood
Bitch call me nice devil
What the hell that was, yeah
And you can call me young money streets
And you can see me for
All the young money beef
I'm the troublemaker
Troublemaker, Ooooh

Call me Mr. Kill em all
Bitch nigga don't get involved
Shoot you on the front porch
And knock you to the backyard
Knock your fuckin back off
Knock your top rack off
You just see Jill on the hill
I knock Jack off
But this ain't nursery
This is brain surgery
Ski masks on my bullets
Let em commit brain burglary
Emergency, it's an emergency
Someone in all black
Left the whole scene burgandy
Kamakazi, you could try me
I'mma shoot ya
When that gun in this position
You could call it Kamasutra
Imma, cock and do it
Like a motha fuckin rooster
You pussy boy
I'm your motha fuckin doucher
Better run like Bobby Boucher
It's Weezy Baby
It's time to induce ya

Really safe in here
Stand up, yeah

And when we do
We come for you
And take your body where
Nobody elses eyes can see
And I told him
Don't start no shit
Won't be no shit.
