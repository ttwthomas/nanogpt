2 ContributorsRock Ice Lyrics
When it comes down to stuntin', I pull it all
When it comes down to G shit, I pull it raw
When it come to pullin' hot girls, I pull 'em all
When it come to rockin' ice, B.G. rock it all
Sport diamonds like I tote a tech
Baby tote a fo' nickel like he wrappin' gifts
Try to stay cool so I don't melt the diamonds 'round my neck
I keep bustas in suspense of what I'ma do next, gotta respect
I ain't out to please a bitch
She could get on her knees
I'm tryin' to get rich
I'm shined out, ten karats on my wrist
Flyin' first class, me and my whole click, now
Fuck a glass, we sip Dom P straight out the bottle, that's how I play it
You know I'm 'bout murderin', I ain't gotta say it
You don't cross me, I don't cross you
But understand a Hot Boy gotta floss too, look, I'm iced out

I rock ice (Lil' daddy)
Every time I step
I rock ice (Lil' momma)
'Cause I love the rep
I rock ice (Whole world)
'Cause I'm doin' my thang
I rock ice
Bling bling, bling bling
I rock ice
You might also like
My Rolex crushed out, my chrome stay spinnin'
Hot Boy wit' so much money, I don't know how to spend it
Don't you wish you could be in my shoes just for a minute
Carry nothin' but faces, never quarters and pennies
I started at nothin', look at me now, I'm iced out
Police think I'm doin' wrong, but nope, I'm right now
It's 'cause I'm black, huh, that you ridin' my back
Paper on everything I have, so how you love that?
They don't wanna see me ballin', wanna see me fallin'
Got it locked off wit' my back against the wallin'
I floss but get dirty too
My Roley cost, try to take it and I'll murder you
Ya say I stunt too much, I can't help it, I be with baby
The number one stunner who drive these girls crazy
The one with the 32 platts in his mouth
Two Rolly's on his wrist, game spitta from the south
Tell me, what kinda nigga rock ice that'll hit ya momma (Momma)

I rock ice (Lil' daddy)
Every time I step
I rock ice (Lil' momma)
'Cause I love the rep
I rock ice (Whole world)
'Cause I'm doin' my thang
I rock ice
Bling bling, bling bling
It's Cash Money youngest nigga
Right around ten figures
That's what I, uh, work with
Pockets are, uh, perkin'
Money is my purpose
Whatever I purchase
Oh, could you do better?
Rollie with the bezel
Who that be, that's Wayne
Look at his gold chain
Sometimes I wear grey
White diamonds, pear shaped
My jewelry just pure awful
And I can't stop thuggin', it's just in my culture
It's a must, everyday I'ma shine, black
You wan' meet me?, you just might need contacts
'Cause I'm the little one with the ice, flossing
Please, playa hater, get your wife off me
I ride by in a Jag with the top low
Throwin' hundreds, but it's cool, 'cause I got more
Me and my niggas, we stunt like there's no tomorrow
Big Tymers, Hot Boys, nigga CMR, nigga CMR

I rock ice (Lil' daddy)
Every time I step
I rock ice (Lil' momma)
'Cause I love the rep
I rock ice (Whole world)
'Cause I'm doin' my thang
I rock ice
Bling bling, bling bling
Now you boys know them 4 99's I got expired
All them bitches plushed out on 20-inch tires
I'm lookin' for some hell of a head, is you for hire?
You lookin' at this Rollie I got, don't you admire
The way a nigga lay a stunt
Braggin' 'bout 20-inch rims, up in the restaurant
But it ain't over, I'm about to go to Disneyland
Yo, you fuckin' deaf now, ya understand?
What if my baby momma's ride by, lookin good
I gave 'em both a hundred G's to get them out the hood
My momma gettin' chauffeured like a movie star
She don't know a damn thing about drivin' a car, I'm rimmed out
Now peep this million dollar smile in my mouth
And all this luxury shit I got in my house
I done sold a million records and I'm still goin'
Don't ask about my watch and my chain, it's still gone

I rock ice (Lil' daddy)
Every time I step
I rock ice (Lil' momma)
'Cause I love the rep
I rock ice (Whole world)
'Cause I'm doin' my thang
I rock ice
Bling bling, bling, bling bling
I rock ice2Embed
