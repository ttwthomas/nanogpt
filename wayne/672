You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause
See Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had

Uhh, ah yeah
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah
You know who you are
I got you140Embed
