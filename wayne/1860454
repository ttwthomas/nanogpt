She a keeper, she keep that pussy wet
She a slurper til it ain't nothing left
The way she drop it on the floor
And baby I know what you want

You're a pretty little thing, shawty I can't even lie
You racking up them sky miles cause you stay fly

And get freaky bring you over, hit that ass just like a rhino

I'm on some gangsta shit, I knock your head off
You bark up my tree, that's a dead dog
Where them hoes at tell 'em I said wassup

Fell in love with me when she saw my tattoo
An' I ain't like these other niggas girl, cause they lame

Got so drunk shit, I forgot her name
Whippin' that Bugatti while she givin' me brain
You the flyest girl I done seen
Bursting outta them jeans

Cause you killin' these other hoes
And I don't mean to be mean, but shawty I'm trying to fuh
