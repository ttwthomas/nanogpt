4 Contributors42 Bars LyricsHey! Look up baby, they write my name in the sky bitch
Don't forget the baby is what I tell the pilot
Don't forget the liquor store is what I tell the driver
Twenty dutchmasters and straight level vodka
I can pedal backwards and still move forward
Look under the mattress, you might find four of 'em
I can go though the atlas without touring
I can fuck an actress and never been in movies
Chea. I'm a cutie, An offspring of mamas beauty
I did overtime, I took papas duty
I'm a man in every sense, I got cents
Since I got rich I got tints on every Bent'
Since I know tension come out them like vents
I vent, and show no relent, money well spent
I'm a hell raiser, blaze a L right in
Front of the laws, I'm tougher than yall
Never really had a pop, so I never had to check in
But I get enough checks, I fuck around and check him
Look, check him out, these is Evisus
America ain't even let them out (ha ha)
I'm feeling great, I'm stepping out
Take ten out, brrraatt, chest is out
And I don't leave paraplegics, I squeeze it
Until I see ya spirit rise with my own eyes nigga
I'm on mine nigga ,I got this like a bitch got time nigga
And I'm the dime type
And I'm walking in the lime light, still like lime
They talking in hindsight, I'm right now
I pull up on ya shawty like SKKRRR
Tryna hop up in this Maybach, I walk way back girl
Come up out that gear asap girl
Whisper in ya ear this Wayne pussy, say it back girl
Now she in the whip with homes
He listening to the same songs I fucked her on
Yeah. I lay back, I'm comfortable
Yeah. Weezy baby boy, lazy boy
Yeah. I did my service in the Navy
Now I'm just a veteran, they forever pay me
Dig me like a shovel, Mama I'm a rebel
I come from under that rock and turned into a pebble
Baby I'm trouble, so turn up the treble
You say it's clever, I call it whateverYou might also like1Embed
