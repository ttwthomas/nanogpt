12 ContributorsWe ’Bout That (Eat the Cake) Lyrics
YMCMB, Cash Money Billionaires
More cake, more money, more hustle
We the business, rich forever

Smoking Kush in my condo
Bitch I'm ballin' hard, you ain't know?
Retro 6′s, new shoe laces
At K.O.D. throwin' ones in strippers faces
Yeah that Ciroc just got me feeling good
You are stuntin' who? Boy I know you wish you could
Cash Money, Young Money
I got retarded paper, I'm talkin' dumb money
Tatted up, it's an Ohio thing
I ain't Tity Boi, but I'm rockin' two chains
Pour it up, go ‘head and roll it up
Walking out the club, drunk as fuck

Hey, stuntin' hard, yeah we 'bout that
Say you getting money huh? Well I doubt that
All I do is ball, everyday
Throwin' cake in a nigga face, eat it anyway
Hey, stuntin' hard, yeah we 'bout that
Say you getting money huh? Well I doubt that
All I do is ball, everyday
Throwin' cake at the strippers, eat it anyway
You might also like
My lil' brother Marley G be on that drink heavy
I run in your fucking mouth at the tooth fairy
Yeah bitch it's Tune, I'm dope in the spoon
I drive a fast car, that bitch go pumeee
What the business is? All my girls pretty
Pussy, money, weed, keep the world spinning
I ball out like the ninth inning, World Series
In the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit
And the weed strong like a pro wrestler
What my pockets on? Nutty Professor
Hit the strip club, throw like 20 racks
I ain't trippin' baby, I'mma get it back
I'm Young Money

Hey, stuntin' hard, yeah we 'bout that
Say you getting money huh? Well I doubt that
All I do is ball, everyday
Throwin' cake in a nigga face, eat it anyway
Hey, stuntin' hard, yeah we 'bout that
Say you getting money huh? Well I doubt that
All I do is ball, everyday
Throwin' cake at the strippers, eat it anyway

I'm on one, yeah I'm hot now
Tell them hatin' ass niggas pi-pi-pipe down
Doing a buck twenty on the highway
Thick red bone looking like Beyonce
Do it for the O, I gotta represent
I hear these clowns talkin' stupid, they ain't makin' sense
I got my mind on my money
Don't know how to Dougie, but all the bitches love me
Wizzle
Hey, stuntin' hard, yeah we 'bout that
Say you getting money huh? Well I doubt that
All I do is ball, everyday
Throwin' cake in a nigga face, eat it anyway
Hey, stuntin' hard, yeah we 'bout that
Say you getting money huh? Well I doubt that
All I do is ball, everyday
Throwin' cake at the strippers, eat it anyway

I told y'all before, nobody can't touch us
YMCMB (motherfucker)
I told y'all before, nobody can't touch us
YMCMB (motherfucker)
I told y'all before, nobody can't touch us
YMCMB (motherfucker)
I told y'all before, nobody can't touch us
YMCMB (motherfucker)

Hey, stuntin' hard, yeah we 'bout that
Say you getting money huh? Well I doubt that
All I do is ball, everyday
Throwin' cake in a nigga face, eat it anyway
Hey, stuntin' hard, yeah we 'bout that
Say you getting money huh? Well I doubt that
All I do is ball, everyday
Throwin' cake at the strippers, eat it anyway2Embed
