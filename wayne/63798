We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better, don't be afraid
We'll do it together
(Lil Wayne)
To the left, to the left
If you wanna leave, be my guest you can step
Feeling irreplaceable listenin' to Beyonce
But okay, I'll put you out on your B-Day
Hey, now if you rockin' with Weezy
Bedroom in the bank, baby we safe
I got game like EA
But I wanna let you play
And don't I treat you like souffle
Don't I look at you like I see a new day
And Don't I do what I do say
I'm through talkin', so i'mma let you 'face
(Chorus)
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better, don't be afraid
We'll do it together
You might also likeWe're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better, don't be afraid
We'll do it together
(Lil Wayne)
It's no sweat, no sweat
I would never 1, 2, 3, 4-get about you
Your love, your sex
You know I work you out like Bowflex
Our jokes, no stress
Love, live life, proceed, progress
Make sure the neighbors get no rest
We can get together, never disconnect
Your back, your neck
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet... to us
So let's project, you stay in, never in-correct
Lemme catch my breath, talkin' 'bout leaving, you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
Then I'mma send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you leaving the best
So you might have to settle for less
I am no Elliott Ness
I don't handcuff, I don't arrest
I do confess to the murders, see
Cause under them sheets, I am a mess
Yes, baby you blessed
Now just don't jump your nest, come on
(Chorus)
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better, don't be afraid
We'll do it together2Embed
