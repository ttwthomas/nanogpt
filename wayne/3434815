Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(So you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)
Sayy
I don't know about but no way boy
Say don't go sell no mo
Boooom
Say don't go sell it no more
Say don't go sell it no more
Say don't go sell it no more
Say don't go sell it no more

Gotta pray to the lord to forgive me for my sins
Everytime my mind make up do it again and again
A rude boyy or B-A-P-P
For this and Everytime my mind make up

Lucifer, son of the morning!
