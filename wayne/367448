7 ContributorsBest Of Me Lyrics
Somebody tell Fat (Fee Baby) to holla at me man
Shit, Louie Baby Wayne Baby
Murda, yes ya'll in Weezy Baby SQADing
Take pictures wit' bricks, some of them wit' quarters
Send 'em cross the border
My bitch is originally from across the border
But once mami cross the border to my hideaway across the border
She lie across the floor an we toss the whore
I'ma floss fa' sure
Cuz my whip is costin' more than all of yours put together
I'm good forever I'm, reppin' my hood
Whenever - Whatever - However you want it
I metal ya homie, hotter than kettles over the stove in the mornin'
And I'm, over the stove in the mornin' with a O of coke and some arm and hammer
I swung wit' the hammer and my arm full of ammo
Face painted like the black Sambo, strapped like Rambo
Can't no, body see the damn flo'
I have his body see the damn flo'
I'm so groovy, I might know how ta play a fuckin' banjo
But I never try and when I was 12 I took a bullet like a man yo
But I never die, I'm here now, I'm that child ta'da
I let the tec bla'daow, If ya sat' down
Oh boy let 'cha hair down ma, ain't got no brain on my sports car
And showty came outta sports bra, becuz I came on her sports bra
I got game like a sports broadcaster, Wayne's your broad master
I have my boys masturbate on ya broad faster
Bag the hard in a plastic
And watch how I go hard on the 'Ave wit' it
I move a Jag tinted in ya residential
Swagger so tight it might pinch you
Ice so bright it might irk you
Slide in er' coupe, rims might hurt you
Interior'll murk you... Sheesh
I got work on every outskirt and
I got her out skirt, our shirt fam
I'm the boy, I said I'm the boy man
Mami can't avoid him my air on Jordans (23s)
She can't lie cuz I glide on Clydes (22s)
When she trying to ride with me
Because I sky on Dominiques (21s)
She not hatin' cuz I rip on G Paytons (20s)
But she love to ride the back of my four wheeler on Daytons
We skatin', you waitin' she real late and damn you real patient
We real players, but we really don't play like
Joseph Forte  got doja or yay
Got bread, got toast and Parkay thats all doe all day
I knocks off hoes all days
I'm mack and vicious, ask ya girl 'bout my dick
She say thats delicious
Ask ya girl did she spit she say thats nutritious
Ask her did she get flipped she say thats tradition
If she say she didn't thats suspicious
You need to stop listenin' to them nasty bitches
