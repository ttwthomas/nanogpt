Hahah..Yeeah, we're all here..
What it do like, just look at it what it is, what it do
(Pump That Bass)
Okay I step up in this bitch I see 'em look at me
I must be water cause women drown when they look at me
Court is now in order baby girl throw the book at me
I do life and make ya my wife
I can be your blanket baby girl I'm your security
Underneath the blanket it's gonna be a conspiracy
Offer me to manage, not takin off ya panties
But I do life if I touch his wife
But she wanna get right, so we do it all night till the woman is like
On my mic, that's a 1-2 check, check for a sound byte, right
Now she ready to spit
If she can swallow her pride then she swallowin' this
I tell her hop up inside that Murcielago, hit the radio and
(Pump that bass)
Yeah
Ay, the rims may offend you on the shit I slide into, fuck you
Bring it to the Dezzy tell ya be cool
Ahem, hold all the pistols, roll by the cops and
(Pump that bass)
Sittin on the corner lookin' like a owner
Talkin' to the owner, ye my price blown up
All in the strip club, never get a boner
Only get hard for D'oh! I'm Homer
And you're a simp son, and I'm a pimp son
And she ain't comin' to the crib till her friend come
We gettin' money over here you need to get some
Out comes the po, steal from my income
Outside where we take it if ya mouth run
Southside where I'm from, that's where ya bitch come
Yeah baby, I pedal the floors up and I'm lettin' the doors up when I

Ay, whatchu know about jeans from Japan
Hand made with the brand on the seam of the pants
And the steam in the seam of the pants also
And the steam, letter B on so don't go no where
Got plenty, more here and there
The shoes I wear you don't own a pair
Get it clear like a mirror, that's why ya girlfriend stare
Just been elected the president's here
Cheers, cheers, tangerine tequila, no beers
Ye, I like this here
Wit Ciara on the track it's music to my ears
That's when I go to the store and I ask for a Philly
If they don't have a Philly, I ask for a Swisha
If they don't have a swisha, I ask for..
That's when I ask for, that's when I ask for a Dutchey!
I ask for a Dutchey, they gotta have a Dutchey
I don't smoke backwoods I just smoke Dutcheys
And mama over there say she gon' fuck me
But, but naw she can't touch me
Cuz my girl is lookin' way good2Embed
