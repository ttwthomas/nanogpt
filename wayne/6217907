DJ Khaled!

Sometimes I laugh so hard that I cry
'Cause you just a joke now, that's brazy
I took a nap and you took your things
And I heard the doorknob, that's brazy
I told you don't trip, got your number blocked
And I done went ghost town, that's brazy
Where all the bitches is at that say
That they don't be doing all this and all that?

She tired of sleeping with bums
I can't even blame her for wantin' to eat cat
I been waking up in her ribs
Sometimes she tell me that loosen her back, damn
Please don't sing that nigga's song
If you do then we can't even kiss after that, yeah
Anytime I pull out that gat on them boys
They must think I'm finna relapse, damn, ayy
.40 cal sit on my lap, wait, don't try to give me no dap
Keep some distance between us, we COVID-19ers
We ain't with that sociable crap, wait
I seen some strippers get jacked, and ain't enough making it clap
You might also like
I know that you're with your friends going brazy, down bad
'Cause they keep asking where I'm at, damn babe
Sometimes they ask and sometimes you lie
But I bet they know now, they ain't brazy
Sometimes it's facts and sometimes it's lies
But they tell you scroll down, they shady
But I ain't gon trip 'cause your number blocked
And that shit is old now, and please say the "Baby," wait
Where all these bitches be at
Since you let them ruin all this and all that?

Fuck it, now my new thing postin' stories about where we went
I know you be spying all in my comments
Moved out Miami and forgot bout the Lambi'
Neighbors just called me, I said "You can have it"
Cut that girl off but I don't do no braggin'
It wasn't me man, it must've been Shaggy
She left me for dead but wanna jump in my casket
She runnin' red, I'm gone in a napkin
My heart is still beatin' and a nigga still need it
I'm back in love, look like I'm fallin' so deep
And she pillow talk with herself, bitch you just dreamin'
And shawty just text me some shit, I ain't read it
And then I delete it
I know that she at his crib going crazy, down bad
'Cause what we had didn't last, damn baby
Sometimes I laugh so hard that I cry
'Cause you just a joke now, I'm brazy
I took a nap and you took your things
And I heard the doorknob, you brazy
But I ain't gon trip, 'cause your number blocked
And that shit is old now, and please say the "Baby," yeah

I know that you at the crib going crazy, down bad
Looking at the ceiling fans, No Ceilings, baby, 3

That's right, No Ceilings 3
