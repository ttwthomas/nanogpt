Got ya dream girl ridin' in ya dream car
She wants me, she wants me
Cause I got it all
Bitch tell me what you don't see yeah
My reality is bigger than ya dreams are
Got ya dream girl ridin' in your dream car
She wants me cause I got it all Bitch tell me what you don't see
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
My reality is bigger than your dreams are
Got ya dream girl ridin' in your dream car
She wants me, she wants me
Cause I got it all
Bitch tell me what you don't see
I got 25 lighters on the dresser
Got a girl and a girl to undress her
My guitar strap is leather
My life is better than ever
I got women all up in my condo
And my drug dealer comes pronto
Got a registered pistol in the console
So, so, don't try me now
Don't try me now
