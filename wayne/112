Start with straight shots and then pop bottles (yeah)
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models (uh-huh)
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles (yeah)
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models
Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
'Cause I ball hard, no bitch, we ball harder
I am the Birdman, and I'm the J.R.-ah

Okay, start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Pour it on the models, shut up bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow, shut up bitch, gargle
Straight up out that water with my Marc Jacobs goggles
I'm fresher than a muh'fucker, yep I'm a muh'fucker
No I wouldn't take your girl but I'll sure take her tongue from her
Can't you tell I'm in love woman, like no other woman?
Oh I'm sorry sweetheart, I thought you were my other woman
My bad!

Start with straight shots and then pop bottles (yeah)
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models (uh-huh)
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles (yeah)
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models
Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
Cause I ball hard, no bitch we ball harder
I am the Birdman, and I'm the J.R.-ah

Now as I recline behind my desk
I ain't got a lot of Nikes but I got a lot of checks (money)
Got my own shoe, brand new on the set
Went from sittin' in a cell, to sittin' on a jet
From shittin' in a cell, to shittin' on a jet
I lost too many friends, but I won too many bets
I made too much money, I ain't make enough yet
So I scratch, and yes, Junior is the best
So many niggas from my hood on they back
So many niggas from your hood on they back
That's why we so paid and it be like that
I'd rather pop a bottle, before I pop a gat

Start with straight shots and then pop bottles (yeah)
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models (well uh-huh)
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles (yeah)
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models
Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
'Cause I ball hard, no bitch, we ball harder
I am the Birdman, and I'm the J.R.-ah

Yeah, only sipping red champagne
White tee, red hat, red bandanna
Uptown, choppers for companions
Fuckin' with the Birdman, we choppin' your companion
Fuckin' with my son and we run up in your mansion
Chopper make music, bitch start dancin'
Stunna man back so you know the circumstances
And I'm cookin' up the "Carter III", no advances
All my cars automative, automatic
No lie, we don't even drive no Aston
Uptown, we packin' and we stackin'
Young Money, Cash Money, we the champions
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles (yeah)
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models (uh-huh)
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles (yeah)
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models
Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game
Look like I got on a championship ring
'Cause I ball hard, no bitch, we ball harder
I am the Birdman, and I'm the J.R.-ah
