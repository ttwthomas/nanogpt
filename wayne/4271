My generation will make a change
(Ooh, we'll make a change)
This generation will make a change
(Yes, we will, yes, we will)
My generation will make a change
(Do you hear me now? We 'bout to make a change)
This generation will make a change
(Yeah)

Boom
Now me love fi see the schoolers them a graduate
A-study hard, and save the party for the holidays
Diplomatic with them diploma and them bound fi great
Because them nah pick up no 'matic and a-perpetrate
And then I love the energies, what them a-generate
My generation, it so special, it will make a change
Because the elders sow the seed and it a-germinate
So anytime them see the progress, them a-celebrate
Because we rising up despite of the economy
And then a-we a-star the show like the astronomy
And how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly
Because we keep remaining true without apology
The mission have fi carry through and finish properly
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe, Paris to Napoli
Say Zambia to Honolulu, back to Tripoli
And everybody want a future living happily

My generation will make a change
(We'll make a change, we'll make a change, yeah)
This generation will make a change
(This generation, yeah)
My generation will make a change
(We'll make a change, we'll make a change, we'll make a change, I swear we will)
This generation will make a change
(I swear it now, yeah, hey!)

Can you blame my generation? Subjected gentrification
Depicting their frustrations over ill instrumentation
'Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing
Placing my life in front of your eyes for your observation
Now if you can't relate then maybe you are too complacent
Athletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements
What's up with tomorrow? Will you lead? Will you follow?
Improve your values, education is real power
I reach 'em like Bono, so get rid of your self sorrow
Add some bravado, get wealthy like Wells Fargo
It's truth that I am you and I am proof
Surviving through, we do what we gotta do
Yo, we could break the cycle, let nobody lie to you
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school
'Cause there's a mission, we gotta finish before we leave
This generation is destined to do historic deeds
My generation will make a change
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
This generation will make a change
(My generation, this generation, yeah)
My generation will make a change
(We'll make a change, we'll make a change, we'll make a change, yeah)
This generation will make a change
(This generation now, hey!)

If you weather that storm, then that rain bring sun
Been a long time coming, I know change gone come (We're makin' a change)
Man, I gotta keep it moving to the beat of my drum
Last night I set the future at the feet of my son
But they thinking that my generation gotta die young
If we all come together then they can't divide one
Don't worry 'bout it, just be about it
Got a message from God: "Heaven too crowded"
But I say, "Hey, young world, you never looked better
And I heard change start with the man in the mirror," uh
This generation, I'mma represent
A generation led by a black president
Now how's that for change? Who knew that can change?
I don’t even look at the flag the same, heck
Uh, so when you finish reading Revelations
Thank God for my generation
My generation will make a change, yes
This generation will make a change, yeah
My generation will make a change for good, for better
This generation will make a change, yeah9Embed
