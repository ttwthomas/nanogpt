Oompa loompa doompa dee doo
I've got a perfect puzzle for you
Oompa loompa doompa dee dee
If you are wise, you'll listen to me
If you are wise, you'll listen to me (Hey)
If you are wise, you'll listen to me (Hey)

They said they did it before Wayne, not like this
Ha, ha, hey
They tryna stop us, Wayne
They can't do it, man, this T-Wayne
Tell these fuck niggas that this is what we (doompa dee doo)
Hahaha, hey, hey
If you're fuckin' with Wayne then you're gon' get the T
(If you are wise, you'll listen to me)

If you was wise enough to get wise and wise up and listen
You wack niggas wouldn't sound so fuckin' insufficient
I'm fishin' for some bitches to give me some Southern fixin's
Fucked her good and when I finished, left her belly button glistenin' (doompety doo)
This isn't just one of them rappin' R&B niggas
I'm fuckin' with Tha Bizness, some of the hardest beat rippers
Fuckin' with the Wayne then you're gon' get the T
(If you are wise, you'll listen to me)
It's like oompa loompa, I am on my new job
Gettin' at your girlfriend, liftin' up her tube top
Call your lady super lube, givin' niggas lube jobs
I'm Teddy Pain, my money long like a tube sock (doompety doo)
I'm cold as fuck but I am also what and who's hot
So I'm obligated to authorize what and who's not
You think I'm wack, but one day you're gon' see
(If you are wise, you'll listen to me), hey
You might also like
Straight out the backseat of the dually with the toolie
I am truly unruly, mic check, one two me
It is Money Mouth Carter, smokin' like runnin' hot water
Better yet like runnin' hot lava (doompety doo)
I am somethin' like a barber 'cause I'll cut your fuckin' head off
And if I'm in the buildin', I've been mothafuckin' paid off
Let me take my shades off so I can fuckin' see, and bitch
(If you are wise, you'll listen to me)
Yeah, shawty got that rebel rap
Like where-where-where your shovel at?
I take a trip to hell and nigga, I'ma bring the devil back
And if you want some trouble, I can have my people schedule that
Damn, your face clear, that's 'cause it's up in Reynold's Wrap ( doompety doo)
This ain't no Nintendo rap 'cause I don't play no games
Bitch, I murder, kill, rob, steal, and fuck on the same watch
That mean at the same time, and my nina sang fine (If you are wise, you'll listen to me)
And I got that auto, that's that T-Pain kind6Embed
