8 ContributorsLove You Right Lyrics
I hear you talking mad shit (Wayne)
I ain't hating but I know she don't love you right (Cherlise)
I hope you walking like you talking girl
Yeah you balking like a bad bitch haha (Wayne)
I ain't hating but I know she don't love you right (Cherlise)
And this called a dog's world (Wayne)

Hi, I'm Tunechi, I'm triple exclusive
I beat the pussy up, abusive
I'm hotter than Lucif'
I'm cooler than Doritos in the blue bag
Oh that's your old man?
Girl you need a new man
I ain't hating, I'm just speaking my mind
And if you ever wanna leave
I got a tree you could climb
Girl your man ain't shit, so fuck that nigga
Just put on your poker face
And straight flush that shit

And I ain't hating but I know she don't love you right
She don't kiss you right, she don't touch you right
And I could give you everything that you want tonight
If you want tonight, I put you on tonight
You might also likeAnd I ain't hating but I know she don't love you right
She don't kiss you right, she don't touch you right
And I could give you everything that you want tonight
If you want tonight, I put you on tonight
Yeahhh

You can keep your credit cards, but don't buy out the bar
'Cuz I'm just trying to see what's in your hair, yeah
I ain't one of these broads, who you be breaking off
I'd rather hit you up on game instead, yeah
I hear a lot of talk but it ain't a lot of walk
And I'm the type of girl that you'll improve, yeah
I need a special kind of dude, yeah
So holla at me if it's you, yeah


I know you thinking you the man, but you should understand
You need something better hanging on your arm, yeah
So here's your chance to, change up your plans boo
Holla at me, my love is the bomb, yeah
I give you something that you can't say no to
Something that you can't refuse, yeah
So don't be acting like you really don't want to
Just man up and make a move, yeah

I promise to be right here baby
Whenever you call me
I'll never keep you waiting for long
Baby, I'll drive you crazy
I'll make sure every night
My body's close and warm
Close to home
