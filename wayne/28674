7 ContributorsStunt When I See You Lyrics
We the best! (Yeah) Who? We! We the best(uh-huh)
Its alot of money on this track(yeah)
So much money we can't even count it
We gotta weigh it
See what we about to do is? (yeah) whats that wayne?
Exactly (listen) what they can't do! True that!

Hay we's the number one stunna ha Bow Weezy(speak)
I spit two hundred now my necks so freezy
Hay look my pockets stay fat like Norbit(damn)
Ball so much that I should play for the Hornets(cash ha)
Rocks so rocky I ain't talkin bout the movie(yep)
Your girl love me when done she wipe me down like Boozie(ha damn)
I keep paper a student in school(okay)
Around her we ride 28's, fuck 22's
Nigga try to stunt on me, I'm a stunt way harder(hay)
Black car spinnin call me, Mr. Tear-The-Mall-Up(ha)
So bring niggas to the left to the left
And I'm all about my benjamins just like Mike Epps(money)
When it comes to the hoes hell yeah I got alot(true)
In the club poppin bottles but my name ain't Yung Joc(ha)
And ya already know I'm the freshest
With some many chains on me it'll make Slick Rick jealous

I'm a young nigga with money
What she gon tell you young nigga with some money
Hey you young nigga with money(thats me)
What you gon' do with all that money?

Every time I see you I'm a stunt (When I see you)

Weezy F. Baby, these hold nomen
Young meal ticket, watch me kick it like Shinobi
Flip it like arobics, my flow is so heroic
My girl got a fat ass and I catch it when she throw it
Ill wet you in the mornin, burn ya in the evenin
Dump ya at night and that duffle bag light
Like my shades hella dark and my red flag bright
Got ya bitch blowin me, like she playin bag pipe
Yep I lay that pipe, I'm the plumber to ya women
Im the flame on the stove, in the desert in the summer
I'mma stunna so, I'm gonna stunt on you bitches
Big tow trucks sitin on chrome inches
My account look like foreign digits
Dont play in that water cause today I'm goin fishin
You dont get it, thats why I punch that 430
Til got it up on inches (too late)
And I'm a young nigga with money
Now what you gon tell a young nigga with MONEY?!
Hey you nigga with money (Yeah)
What you gon' do with all that money? Well

I'ma stunt (What I need to) I'm a stunt (When I see you)
I'ma stunt (When I see) I'm a stunt (When I see)
Every time I see you I'm a stunt (When I see you)

If your watch cost a hundred, you ain't ridin 28's
You ain't stuntin like this (no)
You ain't stuntin like this (no)
And if your crib didn't come with the butlers and the maids
You ain't stuntin like this (no)
You ain't stuntin like this (no)
And if you ask for the price, when you shop at the mall
Then you ain't stuntin like this (no)
Then you ain't stuntin like this (no)
And if you dont make it rain, when your up in the club
Then you ain't stuntin like this (no)
Then you ain't stuntin like this (no) NAW!

Hey you nigga with money (Yeah)
What you gon' do with all that money? Well
I'ma stunt (When I want to) I'm a stunt (When I have to)
I'ma stunt (What I need to) I'm a stunt (When I see you)
I'ma stunt (When I see) I'm a stunt (When I see)
Every time I see you I'm a stunt (When I see you)
Hey you nigga with money (Yeah)
What you gon' do with all that money? Well
I'ma stunt (When I want to) I'm a stunt (When I have to)
