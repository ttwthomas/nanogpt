2 ContributorsStrange Clouds LyricsYeah
Oh yeah I know what we gonna do
Hey
Well, if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly
I just stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian
I hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan
Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians
You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally
I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is
The way I ride on the beat man I be in the street it's done so effortlessly
Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me, there's no Inception in this bitch
I'm top chef, you top ramen, I'm top shelf
No last call, to the bartender, what you got left?
Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah
All night we celebrate, 'cause we everywhere and you not there
Ha
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds
Blue jeans, I'm faded, mindin' my own data
Smokin' on that strong, that Arnold Schwarzenegger
It's Tunechi Lee you bitch you, you hot as an igloo
Kick back on that Glock, call that Ju Jitsu
Hello World, I'm with a yellow girl, number 2 pencil
These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you
My nigga, all day, all night, half pipe
I dive in that pussy, yeah I belly flop, I jackknife and shit
Tell my homies that I say its a party
Got that tech for technical difficulties
I'm top dog, you top ramen, I'm top dog
Piru, gangsters, outlaws yeah
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it, Young mula Baby)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds
Well ain't no question, yes, it's B.o.B yes definitely
Up in the studio, I got on my necessities
If you want that real shit, you made the right selection
I'm Decatur til I die, yes, I rep that definitely
They say I'm a celebrity, what the f-cks a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I, say its a curse but it's emotionally a blessing
To a nigga from the hood tryna aim for the top
But I don't even need no directions
I just wake up and then I roll up the purp
These niggas wake up on my dick
At least have some breakfast first
Nigga keep your nourishment first and your mind on my lyrics
'Cause what you hoping to accomplish I already did it bitch
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we)
(That's how we)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we)
(That's how we)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds (all you see, all you see)
