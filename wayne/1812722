6 ContributorsSecret Weapon Lyrics
Young Money, motherfucker
Young Money motherfucker
So swallo slow, bitch
Suck a whole dick
Yes, they call her L, nigga
And now it's time I bring forth to you, what I call my secret weapon

Young Money got me over here, the girls flying on the lear
Just to boost my career, pop the bottles, fuck the fear
Funny feeling in my tummy, like I'm on a period
Gotta keep that paper coming, gotta make a million
Gotta fuck a Philly chick, everything is real I spit
Riding in that Mozerati, feelin so elegant
See, I felt that ever since
Weezy got me diamond prints
Told me I'm a star, so it's cool, fuck the shiny shit
Blowin like I'm out of it
And my people proud of it
Fuck whoever doubted me
Money, got it all for me
Steppin out the drop and shit
All this, I profit
No, I ain't a door, so you can stop fuckin knocking
Roll with them real niggas, stunt on them fake niggas
I told Weezy I'm starving, where the plate, nigga
Go get the eights, nigga
Let's celebrate, nigga
Bring the ice cream and the cake, nigga
You might also like
Young Money, motherfucker
Young Money motherfucker
So swallo slow, bitch
Suck a whole dick
Yes, they call her L, nigga
And now it's time I bring forth to you, what I call my secret weaponEmbed
