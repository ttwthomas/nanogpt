I'm to clean dey ain't messin with me

I be all ova da bread like sesame seeds
And I be all ova dis beat like a dog with fleas
Yes it's I-uh, chucky I am fly-uh
Call me the fresh prince but to u hatas call me sior
Wait a minute let me put some pimpin in it
Shawty don't be playin ya ain't heard I was the maaaan
Shawty please he ain't got nothin on me
Cause I'm a young hard driver and a 4 mans dream
I'm bout ma cream and I stay super clean from ma shoulders, chest, pant, shoes
You wanna win put ya bets up I'm like a wrestla
(I be all ova da bread like sesame seeds)
Ya digg!

I ain't that cold
I'm 12 yeas old
Ma pants stay saggin cus ma pockets on swoll
Ma mad ma pockets on lean I stay super clean
I'm hot, I'm fresh
Go head and call me crispy cream
Ma flow so mean ma mad ma flow so cold
Hold up a-a chu ice cubes fall out ma nose
When I step up in the buidin
A lil warrior with da dreads
Before I hit the stage the stage run up ma head
Ma people tried again she holla boy is u trippin
Jus go up fa some stacks ya ain't neva gettin it back
Baby boy here to keep it it's our little secret
Cus really I be(all ova da bread like sesame seeds)ya heard me!

Man I'm kicked up like betty crockers boy
U wanna play rough u want some rum rum

I switch ma style like I switch a brand new pair of draws
And dats all the time this here is hamper time
Put me in a dump baby and I'm still gonna shine
And I'm an animal all about ma kemp cream
(all ova da bread like sesame seeds)
I stay g'd up plus I'm iced out
I'm who dey talkin bout young money run da south
So respec it or check it oh I forgot to mention
(all ova da bread like sesame seeds)
Ya digg!
