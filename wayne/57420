7 ContributorsGd Up Lyrics
Wake your punk ass up for the two double oh five brother
Young Money, the future

Hot boy in the building
Rock hard, hard rock hard body got it in the ceiling, yeah
I got burners in the basement money in the mattress
Yo look at their faces, taste it
Yeah I'm nasty right
But my bapes so clean and white look like there's no laces
But I'm not your cow
So I dont walk around with my tongue out
Got a little dough
So I can't walk around with my gun out
So I keep my gun in
Waitin for you to come in
I'm comin with that Bang Bang Bugaloo
Hey stop lookin at me, hater
Or it's gonna be "damn, I ain't look at you"
Now look at us, and if you is I bet you lookin up
How I come with Young Money in the clutch, like Mike
Make me take your lunch money or brunch and your punch
Its Weezy Church!
You might also like
Well I was just ridin in my city ain't stoppin for a hater
Make that get off my face if you ain't talkin about cake
And if you're talkin to my boys get ya brains blowed out
Like the top of every car we probably drive this summer
We G'd Up
We G'd Up
You know we G'd Up
We G'd Up
You know we

It ain't a secret I got my cake up
My rims so big girls checkin their make-up in them
Yeah, the watchband on my Jacob the same color as my bapesters
Harder than from Japan and I'm fittin to change my name to "You-the-Man"
Cause when I ride by girls tell me "You the man"
Yeah, Curren$y the hot spitter yes I am
Rockin the white polo and a pair of plaid pants
I'm on the block in fly boy stance with my argyle socks and my white and green stans
Yeah, thats Adidas homie
I'm chasin this paper cause I need this money
Left one of my girls alone, she's so lonely
Don't even want to eat no more, she gettin' boney
Yeah, haters see me and say "He's so phoney"
Cause I left the price tag on my eveets with woodey

Well I was just ridin in my city ain't stoppin for a hater
Make that get off my face if you ain't talkin about cake
And if you're talkin to my boys get ya brains blowed out
Like the top of every car we probably drive this summer
We G'd Up
We G'd Up
You know we G'd Up (Im G'd up homie)
We G'd Up (Maine for President)
You know we (Lets get it)

I'm tryna cop a house in the East for my shop uptown
Ride up Apple and E and pop uptown
When the time cats run and hide upton
When I'm on tour the only time I'm not uptown
Now don't be wiggin off that E and get F'd up
Thinkin that you're G'd up boy you better ease up
We bleed the hood, the hood bleed us
But every time we hit the hood, the people hollerin out "Jesus"
Become lil nasty, product of his environment
Micky Dees firin, the postal wasn't hirin
Everyday the boy went to sleep to the sirens
And them people swingin round here and they inquirin
Who that is supplyin all that love?
I wouldn't of crept but I was hollerin out "What up blood"
When your relative when I was hollenin "What up cuz" if necessary
My pa was a beast, its hereditary, chyea
Well I was just ridin in my city ain't stoppin for a hater
Make that get off my face if you ain't talkin about cake
And if you're talkin to my boys get ya brains blowed out
Like the top of every car we probably drive this summer
We G'd Up
We G'd Up
You know we G'd Up
We G'd Up
You know we

Young Money
(Young Money boy)
Young Money
(Young Money boys we so fly)
We the Future
(Cash Money boy)
(Cash Money boy)
Well I was Just
Young Maine, Mack Mack Maine
The Hot Spitta, The Hot The Hot Spitta
Wizzle F. Baby, please say the baby
