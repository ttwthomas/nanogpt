Every single day I go and freaking ball (ball)
We getting turned up (turned up)

(Verse 1: Yamine)
I go to the party and get on my grind (yeah bro)
Everybody know that I'm freakin' kind (yeah bro)
White girls always called me nice (what)
So I'd keep them light skins in check for my night (yeah bro)
I had a good time so I'm going to keep on having it (yeah bro)
Ain't nobody stopping me I stay flashing money racks
I'm always getting bank
While all my hoes minds go all blank (ho)
I always stay turnt to my lungs are done (yeah bro)
Every time I go out I wanna have fun (yeah bro)
But what's the point of having fun when have no chick to come (what)

To we fall (to we fall)
Every single day I go and freaking ball (ball)
We getting turned up (turned up)

(I don't remember these hoes, I don't remember these niggas
Fuck niggas, bitches too, all I see is these figures
I got Versace on, Versace lights, I ain't seeing these niggas
Chances here, chances are three on three with these niggas
Look, all bark no bite, all rap no white
Two of her friends to get with my friends so we can be friends well alright
Machine gun, we got one, machine gun I got one
See me, I'm a real nigga, probably mad at me cause he not one
That's straight chopper music, no bite, eighteen dwarf niggas, Snow White
You can bet a nigga if I said a nigga, ten out of ten, it's no white)
[Bitch better have my money
Don’t test me muthafucker I study
And wifey keep tellin’ me the pills gon kill me
Fucking up my sperm count and she want children
Back on my bullshit, I’m back on my bullshit
I’m a dead man walking, follow my footprints
Scared, go to Church, I shoot at the pulpit
My girl pussy sweeter than a whatdyamacallit
I don’t worry ’bout ‘em, I say hi hater
I throw you off the top of a skyscraper]
(Hook: Yamine)
We getting turned (getting turned)
To we fall (to we fall)
Every single day I go and freaking ball (ball)
We getting turned up (turned up)
Yeah turned up (turned up){yeah}Embed
