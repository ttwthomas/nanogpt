9 ContributorsFavorite Things Lyrics
Hoops, cars, big trucks
We ride rims that keep spinning (uh huh)
We stay so fly bandanas and cush linen (uh huh)
Chain swing, pinky ring, diamond things we ain't playing (come on)
These are a few of are favorite things, yeah!

Now I get flyer then most do (yeah)
Higher den most do (yeah)
G4's or better how I fly through the coastal (yeah)
I'm live with the toast dude I'm liable to approach you
Like hi, then bye and I will just roast you
My dudes all the same here, we shoot off and bang here
Red dot your nose like you was Rudolph the Reindeer
I'm fast when I race cars, I smash and I scrape cars
Love candy paint, but still keep my factory paint job (yup yup yup)
I'm a mack and I play hard
Choose a bitch scoop a bitch then back to the playyard (yeah)
Like hey ya hey ma open ya mouth wide put your head down there
Respect me I'm a pimp 'round here
Our doors go up on our whips round here
Cause these are a few of are favorite things (yeah)
We drive

Hoops, cars, big trucks
We ride rims that keep spinning (uh huh)
We stay so fly bandanas and cush linen (uh huh)
Chain swing, pinky ring, diamond things we ain't playing (come on)
These are a few of are favorite things, yeah!

Weezy fucking baby nigga
Pardon me I'm stunting, Tha Carter, yeah I'm young and
Audemars runnin off body temperatures look at you
Looking all shook up, I'm a fly nigga rock my chain when I cook up
Evisu getting took up, Cavallis in the cleaners
Pirellis on the Beamer, I swear that bitch hotter than the bullets in the Nina
You talking to a fever, nigga get your heat up
And I'm a dirty south boy, nigga get your teet up
I hit like Roy not Jones but Williams
Finding me a Kelly make some destiny children
The recipe is Cristal and sizzurp
Call that Crizzurp, get that from Killer
Cam that's my man, and Juelz that's my nigga
Dip-dipset Young Money where the dessert?
Nah where the desert?
It's right up in that May', bitch, under that Corinthian leather
Holla back, nigga

Coupes black, coupes that come with the roof back
Chasing big dough (yeah) making big dough (yeah)

Spectacular chrome down here, that's how it go down here
