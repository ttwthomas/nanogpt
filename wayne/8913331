Where the— where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Whеre the— Wherе the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?” (Yeah, ha)

I got a bitch in the back (Back), got a ho in the front (Front)
Got purp' in the Dutch (Yeah), got purp' in the cup
I tell her, "Get your money, ho, or just stop breathin'
'Cause if it ain't about that dough, it ain't about me, neither" (Gangsta—)
See, a gangsta like myself? I get that paper and pussy
Then I went and make that pussy bring that paper straight to me, bitch!
You lookin' at a real pimp—ask my old hoes (Yeah)
And they'll tell you, no remote, I control hoes
I'm a whole load—give you that game, mama
If he ain't payin', then he shouldn't be playin’—I’m sayin'
Broke niggas only make jokes, nigga (Ha)
I make more then I can fit in this quote, nigga—
Unquote—come sun-soak with me, bitch
Fly you down here and put you on some South Beach shit (Yeah)
And if you smile at my bitch, I make her smile back (Back)
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”

Where the— where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?” (Yeah, ha)Embed
