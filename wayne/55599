167 ContributorsThe Real Her Lyrics
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too
We're perfect for each other

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)

'Cause to her, I'm just a rapper and soon, she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow, we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wan' be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her
And she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi

You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)
Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state
Can't see a play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, "That ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you, baby
"Someone Like You," more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies85Embed
