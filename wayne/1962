55 ContributorsDough Is What I Got Lyrics
This is a public service announcement
Lil Wayne, Weezy F. Baby, is the best rapper alive
Hit me
Haha
Good morning, New York
Good afternoon, New Orleans
Good night, America
Hahahaha
Yeah

Dough is what I got, lil mama
Dough is what I got, pretty lady
Dough is what I got, shawty
Dough is what I got, baby
C'mon, I'm paid, I'm paid
I'm paid, I'm paid

Hey! Give a woman none—uh-uh!
I already gave my brother some
It's my sister turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do bird?
But your boy just relax like a fresh, new perm
As the world, in the barrel of the pistol, turn
And we get it how we live, never live and learn
Gotta talk about the flow 'cause you is concerned
Only down-South rapper could've been in The Firm
Or The Commission or Wu-Tang, nigga
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang, nigga
Got that Sub-Zero flow, how you want me, ma?
Make her "Get over here!" like Scorpion, and
When it comes down to this recording
I must be LeBron James if he's Jordan
No—I won rings with my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same coach, same game, been starting
Same Triangle Offense
I come through the lane like a Dodge, and
Referee niggas is lame, they call charging
I have no brain, I'm retarded
We are not the same, I'm a Martian
You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Morgus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or "late September," whatever you call it
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand: I'm the guardian
And understand: There won't be no guarding him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy running like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm "What's up!?" like Martin
You might also like
Hahaha
Woo!
Yeah! See—
I know y'all talking about me
And y—you don't like what you hear sometimes
But um... um, since I'm so bright
I'ma put the spotlight on you, baby

Show me what you 'bout, lil daddy
I know you need to stop, stop hatin'
I know what you not, whoadie
And that is Weezy Baby
Blunts up, now, blaze (Hey), blaze (Hey)
Blaze (Hey), blaze (Hey)

I'm working—Yeah!
Tell the world, "Take six"
Young Dictionary, make words make sense
Then, I make cents make dollars
Make the skinny girl holler, make the fat girl hungry
Make the ugly girls want me, put the pretty girls on me
Make the shy girls horny, make the fly girls corny
And only for me
Because of who I A-M, holla back in the morning
Hey! Now holla back if you own shit
The CEO of the moment
Bullshit: I don't condone it
Aww, baby, just hop on it
Hahaha
Yeah, ha
You like that
I know!
Marley, what up? Hey! Hey! Hey!

Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shawty
Show me what you got, baby
You rappers ain't safe, safe
Safe, safe, ahh!
