142 ContributorsBugatti Lyrics
We the motherfuckin best, nigga (Mike WiLL Made-It)
Ace Hood
Super, Future (Ear Drummers)

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating (Turn up)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Skrrt)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Woah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Woah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Okay, niggas be hatin', I'm rich as a bitch
One hundred K, I spent that on my wrist
Two hundred dollars, spent that on your bitch
Do me a model, put that on my list
Oh, there he go in that foreign again
Killin' the scene, bring the coroner in
Murder she wrote, swallow or choke
Hit her and go home, won't call her again
Woke up early this morning, crib as big as a college
Smoke me a pound of the loudest
Whippin' some shit with no mileage
Diamonds cost me a fortune
Them horses all in them Porsches
You pussies can't hardly afford it
Forty-two hundred my mortgage
Ballin' on niggas like Kobe
Fuck all you haters, you bore me
Only the real get a piece of the plate
Reppin' my city, I'm runnin' my state
Give me a pistol, then run with the K's
Niggas want beef, then I visit your place (Bang)
You might also like
I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating (Turn up)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Skrrt)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Woah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Woah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Yeah, and I'm at it again
There go that flow bringin' tragedy in
Copped me a chain your salary spent
Niggas is sweet, bring them cavities in
Countin' money, hourly trend
Rolling them skinny like Olsen twins
Niggas is squares, coppin' a Benz
Neck full of gold, Olympian shit
Neimans, I'm blowing the check on they gear
Fall on some pussy, then hop on the Lear
Strapped with them choppers in back of the rear
Sak pase', them killers is here
Woke up early this morning, mind is tellin' me money
Paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumor
Millionaire nigga, no rumor, livin' my life off of tuna
Wanted with me, I deliver the beef
Real niggas only enjoyin' the feast
Pull up a seat, bon appétit
No Louboutins when red on your sneaks (Bang)
I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating (Turn up)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Skrrt)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Woah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Maybach Music, woah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Mastermind, nigga
Photographs of dope boys is all they taking
Finger prints on the Rolls Royce is why they hatin'
Push a button on these broke boys, that's detonation
Walk a road to riches bare feet
I watch mama struggle, now she livin' carefree
That's why I hustle for half a key, that's twelve G's
I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP
You gotta love me, I got shooters out the D-League
Signin' bonus, hit that man that's from thirty feet
Left in a puddle, finger prints is on a hundred mill'
And what it is?
Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood, we hella Trill
Yeah
I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating (Turn up)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Skrrt)
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti118Embed
