Uh, fresh out my Bugatti, Polo on my body
Im jumpin in this shit like a pogo on a potty
So she come and talk to me like Casey, JoJo, and Devante
I say hi my name is Weezy and I know you know Omarion
Haha, I get it in like parking spots
And they say money talk, so dont ask me why I talk a lot
Girl Ill kiss your softest spot, Ill buy your apartment out
Actually I just bought a house, I get it in and walk em out
I done got the dreads braided up, hair long long
And Im with a redbone, that dont want leave her thong on
Its too big, its too wide, it won't fit
But I get it inEmbed
