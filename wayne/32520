11 ContributorsLock U Down Lyrics
Yeah (Uh huh)
Hah
Yes sir
What it is
See
This right here's automatic, man
Understand that
See what you know about
Scott Storch, got torch
And Weezy F, got fire
Yes
And we bringin' back
Miss Mya
Get 'em

(Verse 1)
If I had a dollar for all of the times
I thought I found the right one
I'd be a billionaire
Then I could probably ride out
And go and buy the right one
I wouldn't mind a dude that could take my attitude
And take the time to listen
Someone that understands when I need a little space
And when I need attention
What I'm looking for is
You might also likeHook: Mya
Somebody with direction
Somebody with affection
That knows how to put it on me
That's what I need
Somebody who could read me
Check me when I need to be
Pick me up when I'm fallin'
That's what I need
Chorus: Mya
So when I find you
I'll never let you get away
Never let you slip away
I'ma lock you down, lock you down
And when I see you
I'll never look the other away
Never let you slip away
I'ma lock you down, lock you down
(Verse 2)
I been around
The world a couple times
And I swear it never ceases to
Amaze me (Ceases to amaze me)
How many different
Guys gives the same tired lines
Tryin' to amaze me
You guys gon' take
A lot to put a smile on my face
So I'm not hot maintenance
You just gotta be
Honest from the top
And your heart's gotta be
Dedicated
So what I'm lookin' for is
Repeat Hook

I hope she throw away the key, too
Got me tied up like a three piece suit
Uh
Mya's back
Got a sweet tooth
Miss Caramel, I need three scoops
I can see you
In your beach suit
Walking 'round my beach view
Three bedroom
Penthouse see-through
Just windows
Rich ass nymphos
Baby girl
I can tell you where you need to go
Where you ought to be
On the charter, comin' to Young Carter
You need direction, I could take you further
You need affection, I could crush you harder
You need protection...protection?
Sweetheart, I'm fresh off election
And if you checkin', I won't be far
I'll be right on your radar
Bridge: Mya
Like an anchor in the water
I'd have my priorities in order
That means you'd be the only
One love in my life
I would vow to never leave ya
Rub your back, boy, do anything to please ya
All you gotta do is come around
And I'ma lock you down
Repeat Chorus Twice

All the way down
When I see you
I'll put a padlock on you, baby
No if's and but's or maybe's
All the way down
That's what I'll be for you
I could vow to stay, your lady
Maybe one day, have a baby2Embed
