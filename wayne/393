I love her like—
Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like—
Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like—
Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like—
Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like—

Oh, yes, I love her, like Egyptian
Want a description? Her body's sickening
I can be her prescription, I can be her physician
Sexual healing: I can be her religion
And now, she's kneeling, praying to the ceiling
I bless her as if she sneezed—must be the weather
I dress her: I am her sleeves, I am her feathers
She's fly—flyer than you, flyer than me
I love her; she loves me, too; I love her three times
More than her mom; time will tell that I'm the nigga that
She should—we should be wherever she wanna be on a
Late night, midday, A.M., just say when
And I know I be with cavemen, but never mind them
She's "Poison," and I am Michael Bivins
See, I know that y'all don't hear me, but she does; we does
What grown folk do when they had too much to drink, and I think
We done had too much to drink, and
You might also like
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed

Oh, yes, I love her like I ought to
I see you at the altar, Mrs. Carter
I see you with my daughter, or son—more than one
Maybe five, like the Jacksons, or John Paxson
Just don't let 'em fuck up the mansion
And Daddy will be home later on
Smelling like the cologne that I put on this morn
And I hope that you smell like woman's soap and shampoo
And lotion and perfume and candles
And I'ma run through that pussy like a vandal, yes
I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like she's sweating out a fever—wow!
Leave her to me, and she'll be smiling every single time you see her
From ear to ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated; panties are debated
Einstein: Her head is the greatest
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed

Oh, yes, I love her like her dad told her no man would ever love her—oh, and
I better be the only man sticking it
Licking it like an envelope; mailing it, sealing it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret—don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody—not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it—that ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station, we have sex orientation
When I hit it, she squint like them Orient Asians; I do me
I say, "Hey, Ms. Chun Li, I like to see your booty—
Roll, like sushi"; I'm tryna dip my celery up in her bleu cheese
"Ah"s, "Ooh-wee"s
"Voila"s, "Ta-da"s, "Mhm"s, "Uh-huh"s
"Oh, yeah"s, never "Oh, no"s until I have to go
And then it's: "Never! Oh, no!" I tell her, "Don't cry—
I be back like the electric bill"
And when she butt-naked, she dressed to kill
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed
(Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed; pussy, money, weed37Embed
