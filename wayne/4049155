8 ContributorsTurnin’ Me On (Remix) Lyrics
Please don't turn me on
Get money
Damn, hey, that's how we do it (Remix)
You know what it is, baby
T-Pain, Nappy Boy, yeah
Turnin' you on (Polow Da Don)
Turnin' you on (Keri Hilson)
Turnin' you on (March 24th album coming soon)
Listen

I know I'm turning you on
Chocolate skin popping, I'm so hated on
And I won't let a bitch stop me
My Chevrolet never hesitate to cause a ruckus
Because I got that bass in that motherfucker
I got big shit poppin, look how my truck ride
The Louis V belt with the Louis jump drive
The Louis V shoes and the scarf with it
And the Oakley shades go so hard with it, ayy
I know I'm turning you on
Nappy Boy, digital, got you burning my songs on
'Cause I'm dressed to impress, the best dressed of the night
Nappy time the next slick niggas got me fresh, looking right
Take a step to me, right and I get my swagger up
Now I'm Mick Jagger, slash chainsaw massacre
'Cause I'm on this road like a rolling stone
And I kill every show til they know that I'm gone
I got my chain, watch, bracelet, grill
Top hat leaning let you know that I'm real (You know I'm real, shawty)
Ain't no telling why I take motherfuckers
Make the whole crowd say (Wait a minute)
Motherfucker, you turning me off
You might also like
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proaching e
Dime divas, give it to me
Ah, ah, ah, ah
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proaching me
Dime divas, give it to me

I shot the sheriff
But wait till I shoot these bitches, down, down
Shoot these bitches, down, down
Miss Keri, baby

I ain't trying to start some mess
There's just something on my chest that I need to get off
'Cause you turning me off
Your vision cloudy if you think that you're the best
You can dance, she can sing
But she need to move it to the left, left
She need to go have some babies
She needs to sit down, she fake
Them other chicks ain't even worth my time to talk about
Been had dollars, boy, go on get your money up
Know you're ain't the only homie on melined up
I ain't turning it off, I'm stay turning it on
Go 'head and tell these folks how long I've been writing your songs
I've been putting you on, just check the credits, hoe
And if you want me you can find me in Decatur, hoe
'Cause you're turning me off
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proaching me
Dime divas, give it to me
Ah, ah, ah, ah
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proaching me
Dime divas, give it to me

I'm high as hell, swagger right, float like after life
I got a gorilla appetite, I make you wife my snack at night
Why you still white like aphrodite, that lambo blue, that lambo nice
That lambo bad, that lambo bright
And the cops can kiss my lambo lights, I'm gone
I know, I turn you on
She fell in love with an alien
Now give me my space 'cause that's my home
My now sit on my face like it's your thong
I'm nasty, yeah, I know
I'm nasty like no other, make her say, "You can get it, motherfucker"
I burn you all like a candle
Fire flow, better not wear sandles
Hey, Keri, I'm a bedroom vandel
Run up in your room and make you drop that flannel
I'm just playing, boo, I hope I didn't offend you
But turn you up and on is what a man do
And I'm the man, it ain't no secret, baby
And, this is the remix, baby
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proaching me
Dime divas, give it to me
Ah, ah, ah, ah
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proaching me
Dime divas, give it to me2Embed
