1 ContributorMoment Of Clarity LyricsHa ...... Fix nigga!(Prefix, album this was on)
My mind sporadically
Same time compatibly
Wayne carter graduate bang bang academy
Change my reality
Thank god for grabbin me
Sort of like him cause they can't stop the wrath of me
But hell have no fury
Neither I even I would walk up in the devils kitchen eat a pie
Greedy I never full gettin fat
And bitch i gotta itch so don't let me catch you wit that scra-scra-scratch
Yall niggas off the face of the earth
Even mase came back for the money outta church
So wit that on my mission for that money imma work
My divine intervention might be in that woman's purse
Tryna find a betta system but im runnin out of perk
Baby daughter tell me erks
Then daddy heart hurts
So daddy pop at em until they heart burst
For my baby girl candy i make her starburst
9-11 was a fuckin shame i done saw worst like
What if that bullet would've hit my heart first life
Would it be different i be still fuckin round wit death
Cause i got shot afer that
And after that i grab the empty cases and tried to throw that bitch back at they faces see that i made it
My nigga reel was on the ground like naw i got up and looked around and grabbed the spot like AAAHHH
Im hard to kill Hardy ha
Cut the music back up and keep the party goin
Fuck em
And i dont need no crease
Im a mothafuckin gangsta off eagle street
I dont need the hot boys i still keep my heat
And i ain't gotta squad up i still keep my feet
They call me Michelangelo you paint them so street
But you remove that wallpaper bet that sheet rock weak (haha)
And you and i know whats goin on
You probably ridin to a different song
Im probably ridin on some different chrome
Im probably high in a different zone
But when im off we can get it on
I take no days off catch that shit from my friend
I clock out when i punch in
Im shootin reel you ain't gotta block out its goin in em
Them rats stop hatin on the snake the boy venom
The cat like peyton for the lakers gonna win em
Im certified stamp im a champion
Like would you bontime
Shit i shoot you nine times
Like you was fifty
But you won't be as likely as fifty
I light me some piffy
Like hella-bright on the enffy
Like what nigga like me or lift me
I dont duck i be right in ya city
For them bucks i take me a flight and come and get right, right in ya city yup
Im juss like diddy and nothin like puff yeah
Im sumthin like city he sumthin like young wizzy
My nikes is spiffy im hardly a gotti
Im slightly a nitti all of a carter
Bitch niggas never bitch me
Bum niggas never ditch me
Shit i gotta me man im raw slip me
Thank god for granting me this moment of clarity this moment of honesty ain't no moe squad in me HAAHYou might also likeEmbed
