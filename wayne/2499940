Moolah, moolah

Hey

I've been in the kitchen for that moolah-lah-lah-lah
Keep it strictly business like a suit & tie now
Woah, fly under the radar with my goon, goon, bada
Ain't from Jamaica but we true two shotta, Buju Banton
I got a homie named Gudda, he from the gutter
He keep the cut up, I keep the cutta, we got the cuttas
We in the cut, ready to cut up, who need a cut?
Oozies and pumps, back to the work, ooh we at pump
Oh we is pumpin oh we is right
We got the oh we oh we i got, yeah
That oh we is pumpin go ask the junkies
Only keep real niggas in my circumference
Got my personality rich as a youngin
You know what i did with that nigga i spun
Nigga I stunted, got that shit back so quick
Didn't even miss it, nigga, I'm hustlin'
Nigga, we hustle, pardon the flexin'
Strong armin' niggas and kissin' my muscle, back in the kitchen

Kitchen for that moolah-lah-lah-lah
Back in the kitchen for that moolah-lah-lah-lah

Sell a coke cause crack kills
Sell a dope & pills
Who got the drink i'm all ill
We got that drink it dont spill
