22 ContributorsLove You Fuck You Lyrics
I love you, I hate you and that's why I love her
Nasty by nature, a natural woman
Graphic but graceful, but sassy, but humble
That cat and that face and that ass and them bubbles
She rattle my snake but I bury my shovel
I carry my weight and went tatted my muscle
She act like she’s brazy, I act like I'm dumbo
It's all rice and gravy, it’s all bread and butter (MonstaBeatz)

And sometimes you remind me of my ex
And sometimes you remind me why I left
And sometimes I call you my queen and I watch the throne
Sometimes you call and I just watch the phone, I don't know
That's why I wonder, I wonder how many stars you done seen
While we fucking, while we fucking, yeah
I wonder how many calls you done screened
While we fucking and didn't say nothing
I don't know whether to love you or fuck you
Love you or fuck you, love you or fuck you
Girl, I don't know whether to love you or fuck you
Kiss you or cuss you, trick you or trust you
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, look
I’ve been here, I’ve been waiting on you, yeah
Waiting on you,  on you yeah
See what time it is, time to make your move, ooh
You might also like
You should have your phone unlocked if you really love me
Throw that bitch a block if she was really nothing
Would I go through your phone locked?
So now I'm deep in my emotions
’Cause I saw her shoot her shot, and you replied with some emojis
I don't need a friendly motherfucker for a boyfriend
Who forget about me when he's drinking with the broskis
I just want a family man, RIP Kobe
Someone I can bend with, someone that'll hold me and love me
OD, OD, OD
Nine games, we can go to OT
KO if I fuck your homies
Careful if you really love me
Better block those shots like you’re a goalie

I wonder how many stars you done seen
While we fucking, while we fucking, yeah
I wonder how many calls you done screened
While we fucking and didn't say nothing
Yeah, and sometimes you remind me of my ex
Sometimes you remind me why I left
Sometimes I call you my queen and I watch the throne
Sometimes you call and I just watch the phone
I don't know whether to love you or fuck you
Love you or fuck you, love you or fuck you
Girl, I don't know whether to love you or fuck you
Rub you or touch you, hug you or cuddle
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, look
I've been here, I've been waiting on you, yeah
Waiting on you, on you, yeah
See what time it is, time to make your move, ooh
No cap
I love you, I hate you and that's why I love you
Nasty by nature, a natural woman
Graphic but graceful, but sassy, but humble
That cat and that face and that ass and them bubbles
She rattle my snake but I bury my shovel
I carry my weight and went tatted my muscle
She act like she's brazy, I act like I'm dumbo
It's all rice and gravy, it's all bread and butter1Embed
