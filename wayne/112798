2 ContributorsKiss The Game Goodbye LyricsG-g-good afternoon call me young tune
I'm D O P and E all in one spoon
New Orleans law-layer, USC text spill
Rappa slash rocka, jazzy like a sax player
But I'm an ex player you can ask players
I don't got stacks I got layers
I outweigh yours, pick the scale up
Married to the game, pick the veil up 
Kiss the game goodbye y'all dry
I Mr. Potatoe head to you small fries
Yeah, you could check my archives
And they nickname my swagga "sharp knives"
Ha ha, first name I thoughts wise
Last name Carter to rappers I'm Jaws five
Last name Carter to rappers I'm Saw five
Young Mula baby
Kiss the game goodbye You might also likeEmbed
