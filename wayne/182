No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

Mr. West is in the buildin'
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Ayo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermès, Pastelle, I pass the dressin'
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
"Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?"
'Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan
You might also like
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, 'cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, 'cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes
(Yes…) But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooovaaaa
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hooooovaaaa
Did you even have any doubt? After Doubt it was over
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Church, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire
I got stripes, Adidas
Mami scream "¡Papí, no más!"
Run up in your shit, just me, no mask
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us, 'cause we the only thing to talk about
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (And I'm gone)
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Wow!)
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Ha! Ya think)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (That's right!)

Aye, you can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity, and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin' what you kickin', then you worthless
Lookin' from the surface
It may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit, hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

No one on the corner has swagger like us (Okay)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah, That's right)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Okay)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah, so you notice, huh?)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Ha! Yeah!)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Okay, tell'em for me shawty)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Yeah, that's right)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah!)

No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us35Embed
