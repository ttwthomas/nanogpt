6 ContributorsMula (Remix) Lyrics
Got that Remedy, yeah
Cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula

I cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula (yeah)
Took her to the mall, then I took her to the jeweller (yeah)
I might fuck around, then go put her in the bank (yeah)
When you gettin' money, give a fuck 'bout what they think (yeah)
Like oh woah, oh, oh, oh
Cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula
Like oh woah, oh, oh, oh
Cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula (yeah)

I done fell in love, with some money (yeah, some money)
I done left my girl, I ain't sorry (yea, sorry)
Nigga, think about when I was broke (yeah, I'm broke)
Fuck that, I ain't goin' back no more (yeah, no more)
Fuck around and found some dope (some dope)
I ain't finna hit no licks no more (no more)
I'ma take Mula to the jeweller
Diamonds on my neck, freezin' like a cooler
Like woah, woah, damn my nigga, froze
Nigga, gettin' money now (money now)

Where the fuck, was you was at?
When I was broke?
Only stickin' with my day ones

I cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula
Mula on my mind, on my mind, brain tumor
So addicted to her, faithful and restricted to her
I know she been around but a lot of niggas blew her
I'ma take good care of her
Make sure you aware of her
Put her on the table, break her down like a skeleton
Sippin' on the gelatin
Smokin' on the melatin
It's just me and my girlfriend, Makaveli-in'
I told wifey she too pricey
And then I went got icy
A nigga get poltergeist-y for the Breitling
If you baller blocking, invite me
I cheated on my girl, she still recuperating
It's Weezy Baby and Mula
But our friends call us Mula Baby
I'm gone
I cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula (yeah)
Took her to the mall, then I took her to the jeweller (yeah)
I might fuck around, then go put her in the bank (yeah)
When you gettin' money, give a fuck 'bout what they think (yeah)
Like oh woah, oh, oh, oh
Cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula
Like oh woah, oh, oh, oh
Cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula (yeah)

Cheated on my girl with a bitch named Mula (yeah)2Embed
