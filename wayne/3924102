16 ContributorsDeep Sleep Lyrics
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake

She got a pussy like the Garden of Eden
I tip-toe through the tulips
And I'ma do me, scratch me off my to-do list
I got flies all on my new shit
Loose lips sink the cruise ship
Even gigabyte get their two chip
Havin' a pillow fight with a cute bitch
With a body like a belly dancer
She say you scared of this pussy cat, well if that's a panther
I hope it's pink, I read her mind, yeah I read every chapter
Sit on this dick, feel like you flyin' on a pterodactyl
I ain't got time to play no games
Gimme mind, don't play no games
She say she'll slit me if I'm vain, I said "objection, sustained"
This shouldn't affect my affection
She say she sent from Heaven
That's why all flights were connected
I still use protection, if she's a blessing in disguise
But I swear it's a damn good disguise, because I can't tell
She wish she had me on lock
But there's so many other niggas doin' time
In her brain cells, damn, uh
You might also like
No, no, staying awake
Am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
No, no, staying awake

Uh, am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
My heart beat echoes 'cause my insides are hallow
If anyone have a towel, wipe the guilt off my face
My high's comin' down like my stilts about to break
She tell shit I never heard when I thought I heard it all
Like you perfect but not flawless but you got the perfect flaws
And what goes around, comes around, out a swirly straw
Then she put that shit on me, I feel like some dirty draws
She say "just don't leave me Wayne, 'cause life is short"
I say "I'm touched but baby, pimpin' ain't a contact sport"
She dyed her hair, I asked her "when's the funeral?"
She laughed and said "you crazy," I said "look who's talking"
And Gisselle may leave her house without makeup and still be pretty
But I wonder if I leave yo' ass, would I still be shitty?
I pour champagne on her, she put cocaine on mine
And we forget everything and six-six-six nine, alright

No, no, staying awake
How the hell should I know, am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
No, no, staying awake
Oh, how well do I know that I'm sleepin' with the devil
Hot pussy loosie, she be goin' at my neck
But I be shot, puttin' loosie, and I sweat when I'm around her
Regret when I'm around her
Ask me "would I die for her?" I say "dead before designer"
'Cause I see through her flames and she see through my snow
She gon' be singin' the blues, hope she could hit them high notes
Pour me a drink of some few and let me spit on this ho
I told that bitch to be cool, like the temperature low
With yo' fine ass, she tell me "gimme some more"
Like high grass but I just trim it and go, I'm on my nigga shit
I call her wifey, she call me a polygamist
And I swear that pussy taste like Devil's Food Cake
Give me a toothache, I feel like fool's gold on April Fool's Day
But I ain't a fool for love 'cause play with love, you get hurt
Play with pussy, get wet, play with fire, get burn, the roof

No, no, staying awake
Am I sleepin' with the devil? Hell if I know
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake4Embed
