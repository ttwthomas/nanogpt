7 ContributorsBig Dawg Lyrics
Weed and syrup again

Hey, I say money ain't a thing to a big dawg
Ain't got nothing but some cash, I'm a big boss
And I got my goods, and I got my guns, and I got my goons where they supposed to be
Hey, I say money ain't a thing to a big dawg
They can pow pow, at this big dawg
Tell the world I'm ready, wait till they get a load of me

I'm in the Maserati and it costs one fourty
I'm a ghetto boy I came up off Brad Jordan
I'm sawing this something for them
Shawty fuck your boyfriend
I am so fly it look like I get dressed in hourse pill
Vehicular homicide boy you know my car kill
Orange and black Chevy, now I'm riding Garfield
I'm standing by the bar steel running up my bar bill
Yeah I push weight my bag feel like barbel
I'm a big dawg look at my big dawg watch
See we the big dawgs that all the big dawgs watch
Got that constipated flow, you know this shit's on lock
And shawty even when its cold, they be like Tit Boy hot, ya digg!

Hey, I say money ain't a thing to a big dawg
Ain't got nothing but some cash, I'm a big boss
And I got my goods, and I got my guns, and I got my goons where they supposed to be
Hey, I say money ain't a thing to a big dawg
They can pow pow, at this big dawg
Tell the world I'm ready, wait till they get a load of me

Shawty wanna go to the mall so I took her
Keep it on the low man I just left her sister
More mail than the rest of the pushers
Because I got another bird in the bushes
Quick up baby that other shit whip and whip that baby
Drought time maybe
We can do a deal somethin' sweet like Sadie
If not I'm getting money nigga fuck you pay me
I gotta get mines, you gotta get yours
If worse come to worse we can just go to war
What you think all these guns is for, 45 44 some fly we so high

Hey, I say money ain't a thing to a big dawg
Ain't got nothing but some cash, I'm a big boss
And I got my goods, and I got my guns, and I got my goons where they supposed to be
Hey, I say money ain't a thing to a big dawg
They can pow pow, at this big dawg
Tell the world I'm ready, wait till they get a load of me
Tell the world I'm ready, I'm coming, I'm here
Money ain't a thinggg, ohhh ohh oh oh
I'm ready, I'm coming, I'm here
And I'm a big dawg!1Embed
