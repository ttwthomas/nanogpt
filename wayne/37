77 ContributorsRide for My Niggas (Sky is the Limit) Lyrics
Ahem
Weezy F
Young Money, Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3, ladies and gentlemen
And you know me
Let's go

You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me, "Don't get high" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing

My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it; if she steal it, I'ma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillos
And fuck your hospital — Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like C-Y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a lil' intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See, my world is different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing
You might also like
And you know that I’ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don’t worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
‘Cause the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I’m gon' be in it
The sky is the limit (Errrrrrrr!)

Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, "Don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free"
And I hate when a nigga say, "Talk is cheap"
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me, yeah
My flow is art — unique, yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is "Eat"
By any means, and you just sardines
I got the 40-cal. tucked in my P-R-Ps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand-new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours
And I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And I'ma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit

And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting
On the living room sofa — that's fucked up, haha
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
Haha, now that's fucked up
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit, but I cannot forget the streets
So you know that I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Don't worry about mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me, "Don't get high" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
If you don't remember nothing, man, the sky is the limit35Embed
