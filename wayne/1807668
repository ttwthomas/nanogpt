8 ContributorsPriceless Lyrics
Here I go again
Staring into the mirror
To no reflection
Like am I here
Paranoid, who's there
I know in my years
I done seen my share
Everything I bare
Everything I care about
Has all been washed up, way to the shore
But we got more
More in store

This for you bird lady
Yeah young
100
Back on the bitches
Rollin in the Bentley
Them suicide doors
Cost me 650
Lamborghini yella
Could do it no better
Burnin in the sky
Float like a feather
Them stars worth the price
And music brought the lights
5 star G
Give my son 5 mics
Fully loaded with the piece
Hundred mill is the feast
So we ate the same meal
Till the hundreds had a crease
So you know we bought some (fleach)?
Rolls Royce and Hum V's
Keep a bad bitch
And put the diamonds on my teeth
Presidential suite
Rumors bout me
Rumors bout my son, bitch
Dying in the streets
It can't be
You might also like
And we hear everybody talkin
We know they talkin about shit, about shit
Cause I swear it was just the other day
I told my nigga we goin get about this, about this
And we goin keep our guns
Cause we live a block from
Danger, trouble, and every drug you can name
Yeah it's true
Struggle and pain
Hustle and gain
Thrust through the chain
Now motherfucker, do you buy that
Motherfucker, do you buy that

But I'm priceless
I'm lifeless
I'm wifeless
I'm the nicest
And I'm priceless
I'm lifeless
I'm wifeless
I'm priceless

Ferrari
You can find me on the southside
Uptown with the Louie on the rightside
We so high
To the sky where the sun shine
There's no price on the tag
That we can't buy
Flyer than a pearl
Cuter than some jewels
Hot with the shades
Flame on you
Country niggas paid
New Bentley coup
20 on some blaze
Marc Jacob shoes
Frank Muller watch
The square block bezzle
Junior is the best
Fly in any weather
I mill cash bitch
Out the louie brief
Euros and currency
But this is C.M.B
But I'm priceless
I'm lifeless
I'm wifeless
I'm the nicest
And I'm priceless
I'm lifeless
I'm wifeless
I'm priceless

When you're staying
In this room
With all these doors
And no where to go
Ah ah ohhh
All these doors
But I chose
The window

The big block (phofer)?
50 before we mash out
It's candy on the slab, nigga
Before we burn out
It's billionaire frames
Cherry wood grain
Two on the Benz
Glass top switching lanes
Hundred thousand acres
10 on the hill
Over city view
Get it how you live
Down in the jungle
Learn to keep it humble
I be about your business
Cook it like it's gumbo
Mink on the spread
Mill on the bed
Marble on the floor
Ice chandeliers
A paranoid life
Rich with no wife
Higher than a kite
Smash it butterfly
And we fly
And I fly high
Higher than your eyes can see
But I'm coming down
And I'm coming down
So you bitches better get down with me
Now motherfucker, do you buy that, yeahhh
Now motherfucker, do you buy that

But I'm priceless
I'm lifeless
I'm wifeless
I'm the nicest
And I'm priceless
I'm lifeless
I'm wifeless
I'm priceless
Ooooh
Yeahhhh
Ayyyy
Yeah
Yeah
Hayyy
But I'm priceless
I'm lifeless
I'm wifeless
I'm the nicest
I'm lifeless
I'm wifeless
I'm priceless
Now hurry up and buyEmbed
