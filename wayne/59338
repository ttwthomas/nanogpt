34 ContributorsBang Bang Pow Pow Lyrics
My money right (my money, money), my bread good (good, good)
Shawty fuckin’ (wassup, girl?), that head good!
Bang, bang, pow, pow
I do my thang, thang, look at me now, now
My money right (my money, money), my cash up (up up and away)
Face down (face down), ass up
I rep my town, town, that’s where I’m from, from
So, nigga, pow, pow, bum, bum

Money to blow, I’m limpin' off tour
Boatloads of cash, bitch, I’m overboard
I got money for these whores if you open up the door
Company accounts and they all on one accord
Real talk, I don’t speak, even if it’s “Hi, hater”
I’m on top and I done locked the elevator
All these bitches say I'm fly and I can never touch the ground
I’m not tryna be in your circle cause I don’t fuck around
I get that money, that money (money)
I live it, I want it (want it)
Drop the top on that Ferrari, now I’m in California
I let the hardtop down and the wind blow through
All I do is win, what the fuck you gon' do?
I'm good, good, good and
I do this for my hood, hood, hood
Yeah, and ain't nobody gonna stop me I doing it right now
So bang, bang, pow, pow, everybody say
See T-Pain LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
My money right (my money, money), my bread good (good, good)
Shawty fuckin’ (wassup, girl?), that head good!
Bang, bang, pow, pow
I do my thang, thang, look at me now, now
My money right (my money, money), my cash up (up up and away)
Face down (face down), ass up
I rep my town, town, that’s where I’m from, from
So, nigga, pow, pow, bum, bum

I go so hard they call me go so hard
You ain't a king, you a joker card
Fuckin’ up the Church money like a alter boy
I got them yellow Xannies, that's them Tonka toys
I go bonkers, boy, I put that on my mamma nem
These hoes are all alike, they put the 'ho' in homonym
I think all these niggas sound like me, that’s a compliment
I told a midget "Bitch, I do it big, hippopotamus"
Put that on my Slime and ‘em, no b-ball, we stop and pop
No b-ball, we got shit locked, swagger ill, wassup, doc?
Make that pussy pop like the gun I went to jail for
Shoot the doors off that Jeep, that bitch look like a mail truck
Ya pussy, keep ya tail tucked, real niggas in this bitch
Get that pussy wet, fuck her than I jet, Kenny Smith
T-Pain voice, all I do is win and shit
Young Money in ya muthafuckin’ face, blemishes
My money right (my money, money), my bread good (good, good)
Shawty fuckin’ (wassup, girl?), that head good!
Bang, bang, pow, pow
I do my thang, thang, look at me now, now
My money right (my money, money), my cash up (up up and away)
Face down (face down), ass up
I rep my town, town, that’s where I’m from, from
So, nigga, pow, pow, bum, bum5Embed
