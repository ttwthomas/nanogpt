3 ContributorsShe Don’t Put It Down (Video Remix) Lyrics
Ugh, shorty old news though
Yesterday paper
Check this, ugh

Baby like it raw
I don't even waste a magnum on her
Clean up amazing I appreciate the fashion on her
Badder than a mother fuck
Ain't too many passin' on her
Only right I pick her up
The way she got a wagon on her
When I'm on that road don't forget the bops when I'm in town
Not unless its for the three some if its poppin' she'll be down
Know these other joker be starin' but stop when I'm around
First to get inside them jeans she be hoppin' up and down
Let the world know that she ride think that eventually will break up
And I love it when we argue cause eventually we make up
I mean...
We fight and fuck
We fuck and fight
We fuck some more
Every fuckin' night
Shape great, taste great, body softer than cashmere
Anytime her cheques drop she knows she can crash here
Them other broads is other broads
All of them is last year
Can't get mad I'm just stating facts here
You might also like
She don’t put it down like you (down down like you)
(she dont, she dont)

Never trippin' off the past
I would rather never mind 'em
Cause only fools trip over somethin' that be behind 'em
And yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
She here at the present time
It feel like a gift when she put it down down
All the way down, you could get down, but can you stay down?
Shout out to the ladies with your down asses
That keep a tight circle and 'em round asses
At the crib its just Us nigga
Fuck me so good make me not trust niggas
That's my shit
I'm over protected
You want that good shit you know where your connect live
Told my ex don't be bitter be better
I replace her before I regret her
Text's now and then, that question how I been?
The hook sound like a message I would send

I can see the stars in the day time
Bitch, I miss you like a deadline
And the girl I’m with is just the girl I’m with
I mean it’s working out, so we’re staying fit
But you know love is nothing, ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?
I used to go dummy in that pussy, crash test
You be fucking that nigga like you was fucking me?
Ha, fuck that nigga, he can’t fuck with me
I’m Tunechi bitch and you know that, and that pussy throw back
But given night, I’d still pop that ass like a Prozac
Girl you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me and I know ya still for me
That’s why we still fucking, cause she don’t put it down like you

I'da put another in your space
Damn after you it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sittin’ on the case
She gon’ hate but she know
