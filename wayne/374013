There comes a time
When we heed a certain call

When the world must come together as one

There are people dying

And it's time to lend a hand to life

The greatest gift of all

We can't go on
Pretending day by day

That someone somehow will soon make a change

We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth you know: love is all we need
You might also like
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Well, send them your heart
So they'll know that someone cares
So their cries for help
Will not be in vain
We can't let them suffer
No, we cannot turn away
Right now they need a helping hand

Nou sé mond la
We are the Children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
When you're down and out
And there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, let us realize
That a change can only come when we
Stand together as one

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

Better start giving

There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives

It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
We are the world
We are the children

It's for the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day

So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me

Come on now let me hear you

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving

Choice were making
Saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up look around and see that your dream's gone
When the earthquakes we'll help you make it through the storm
When the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
We are the world united by love so strong
When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road you're walking on
A signpost to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the world connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet's singing along

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me

Everyday citizens
Everybody pitching in
Nou sé mond la
Nou sé timoun yo
You and I
You and I
Uh, twelve days, no water
What's your will to live?
We amplified the love we watching multiply
Feeling like the world's end
We can make the world win
Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
And now Haiti needs us, they need us, they need us

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
Nou sé mond la
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me

Haiti, Haiti, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
