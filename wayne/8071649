Young Moolah baby!
You know we had to do a remix right?
(Hey lil' mama, hey hey lil' mama)

Hey lil' mama, fuck all that drama
Hop yo ass up in the drop
You know I had to turn it up, because the weather gettin' hot
They see me pull up to the spot
Now they jumpin' on my cock
They wanna li-li-li-li-lick me like a lollipop
Oh yessir, we gettin' gwap and we poppin'
We made you move, bass stopin
We know them losers be plottin'
But losing never a option
I pop the coop, with the invisible top
We be shutting n* down in the parking lot
Oh fo sho
Her booty clapping and she make her pussie pop
I'm like Ray J with the camera
Later on we can watch
I'm like, I'm like oohhh, I'm a south side
Had the air high note
She singin' in auto tune like ooh, (like) ooh, (like) ooh, (like) baby, aaaahhhh
Yeah, I like that, I'm right back
Wherever them dykes at I like them girls that like them girls that like them boys
To put the whores on the right track
I pop the 6 with different chicks, in different kicks
I'm not like you snitching pricks
I like to do some different shit
You n* wish you could spit it like Vic
Cuz, the whole bay be on my dick
You might also like

Hey lil' mama it's Carter, the boss
And I don't like my dick sticky so wipe off that lip gloss
Weezy baby bitch I don't mean no harm
But I swear I'm a goon, just like go on
I told her like a di-no-saur
Bitch they don't make 'em like me no more
So make history or leave my car
And since I be so high they think I'm fucking a star
I ain't gon' lie I be fuckin' some stars
Pussy so wet it get stuck in them draws
Then we fuck like retards
That pussy hot, she got a stick a hockey puck in her draws
And I be Wayne Gretzky
Take the bitch to South Beach and fuck her on a jet ski
Then it's bye lil mama
And now I'm all sick cuz I done ate her ill nana
I'm a nasty ass n* , and every woman in the world like a nasty ass n*
So here I am baby, fuck him baby
You want a family? Then you can swallow ten babies
Damone I'm gone but before I go
I don't love them hoes, Young Moolah, babyEmbed
