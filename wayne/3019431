Chyea! Dipset, fuck with ya boy
It's Santana
Yea man
I'm back at it
C'mon

Uhh, gangstas niggas and bitches
I'm back on my A game is you getting the picture? (Whattup)
And last album they don't like me to tell this
They undershipped my records ain't expect me to sell shit (Shut up)
That's what they telling me, switch up yo' melody
You hot but you go pop, your record'll be selling three
Fuck off, I ain't no damn puppet
Imma do what I wanna do just as long as my fans love it
And if that can't cut it, fuck it, drop me
Watch me blow up on another label I'm cocky
You better realize pa, I'm a real live star
Ask your kids if they feel my bars they'll tell you hell yea
Ask him is he just running his mouth or is he really the one to look out for
They'll tell you hell yea, he's the one to look out for
He's not just running his mouth y'all (Uh-uh, no way)
I been hotter than you dudes
To me this shit is easier than tying my two shoes
You young cats sound old and retired like yo flows on a diet
You ain't feeding the people right
It's like food when I rap
They get fooled when I rap
Like Slick Rick said, the ruler is back
You might also like
8 AM, open my eyes
Yeah, kick my bitch, tell her open the blinds
And I'm over the stove at 9
Yeah I'm cookin breakfast for the block then I let her cook mine
Yeah quick line in the bathroom before we bounce
Not me, I mean her, she go a-day-an ounce (dang)
Y'all pray for her
While I'm at the bus station in the Bentley sitting low as I wait for her
I'm gettin' dough, I'm a paper-boy, I will take you
For the right paper boy I will take her
Shake her, tape her, waist up
Send her to the money, she be back before I wake up
Get ya cake up
Y'all niggas lame ducks
You probably get your game up when I'm giving the game up
My name Wayne, what
Hot boy flame up
You niggas trying to change up and I'm getting my change upEmbed
