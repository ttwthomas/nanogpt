32 ContributorsAmerican Superstar Lyrics
Look at me, bitch, look at me, bitch
Look at me, bitch, I'm an American superstar

I got guns for the snitches, roses for the bitches
Hop up out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures
I got guns for the snitches and roses for the bitches
Hopping out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures
Got guns for the snitches, roses for the bitches
Hop up out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures
I got guns for the snitches, roses for the bitches
Hopping out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures

Heavy metal for them boys, plenty petals for them gals
Got an appetite for destruction, you can call me Axl
Ask me bout what a nigga done done
Ask me bout what a nigga do well
Ask me bout where them bricks come from
That's what a snitch nigga do, they tell
I don't want nothing to do wit that there
If its a lick then I'm bringing them shells
Only position for me is a player
That's rite player, better get it right player
Might have to be an emergency
Lucky for you I'm up blowing my trees
Calming my nerves, no regular weed
Or somebody's shorty wit me, on her knees
I'm ready if its a problem, she sexy, Flo Rida hotter
Come test me get that revolver, ya messy just like a mobster
My broads deserve lobster, you're flawed, deserve choppers
Get served like Jimmy Hoffa, American show stopper
See Flo Rida LiveGet tickets as low as $17You might also like
I got guns for the snitches, and roses for the bitches
Hopping out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures
Got guns for the snitches, roses for the bitches
Hop up out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures
I got guns for the snitches, roses for the bitches
Hopping out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures, like
Look at me bitch, look at me bitch

(Young Mula, baby!)
I got money on money on money on money
On top of more money, on top of my shit like flies
Open that Ferrari F-5 like eyes
Bumpin' down Ocean Drive
Jumpin out that Maybach with a bitch
Went back to tease them thighs
She gotta tattoo on her booty and it said 305
DJ Khaled say it's a movie now, don't forget your lines
'Cause you don't want me to edit, before we roll them credits
Bitch, give me my credit, I'm so energetic
I'm fucking like a rabbit, smoking on lettuce
Whatever I want I get it, I meant it if I said
And I say I keep a pump, and I ain't talking unleaded
If you want it come get it, cause boy I'm ready
I get that fast 'fetti, they should call me Tom Petty
Got two bitches, one peanut butter one jelly
I'm an american gangsta, already and I'm an American superstar
I got guns for the snitches, roses for the bitches
Hop up out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures
I got guns for the snitches and roses for the bitches
Hopping out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures
Got guns for the snitches, roses for the bitches
Hop up out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures
I got guns for the snitches, roses for the bitches
Hopping out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures

I'm an American superstar, yeah
I'm an American superstar, yeah
I'm an American superstar, yeah
Baby, I'm an American superstar, haha1Embed
