Cause when I hit the (brrrr) he always got the packs

If you don't love Cash Money you can stay broke
Fifty on the chain twenty for the piece
A grand for the bitch the whip is not a lease
You know I'm stuntin' hard Phantom in the front yard
Put Ross on the front just to front hard

Yeah I know what I'm doin'

Started with some hubbers 12 years old
Man I swear to God I was 12 years old
My mama didn't know and Stunna ain't know 'bout it
'Til the day I got shot they found some money in my pocket
Yeah... I know a nigga named Big Rufus that'll break ya off
Them niggas runnin' up the terminal we takin' off
They say that money turn a model bitch into a dog
And I got a couple Eva Pigfords in my backyard
Nigga I mack hard, bitch I'm a bad boy
Fuck a security guard I turn 'em into track stars
You know my name baby, that's Weezy Fuckin' Baby
And if that nigga hatin' on ya, then fuck him baby
I tell 'em fuck 'em girl
18 inch windows in my crib you'll see the whole world
Bitch what you tryna do? I haven't spent the check yet off Tha Carter II
I am that fuckin' dude now who the fuck are you?
