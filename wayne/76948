13 ContributorsNina Lyrics
Now it was me and Lil CC and we was chilling by ourselves
Both of us just popped a pill and now I'm feeling myself
All these cuts on my wrist, it's like I'm killing myself
Diamond cuts is what I mean, I'm so hot, I might melt
Only in your bitch mouth, nigga, what you talking 'bout?
You ain't talking 'bout shit if you ain't talking bout this
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout my bitch
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout my bitch

I got a bitch named Nina, and Nina so slutty
'Cause she'll do him and every one of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and every one of his buddies, yeah
She'll do him and every one of his buddies
Protection off-safety, I look straight ahead
"I got them niggas, Weezy"—that's what the .380 said
"I got them niggas, Weezy"—that's what the .380 said
That's what the .380 said, that's what the .380 said

Man y'all ain't ready
I'll take on the world, and it's just me and Lil Terry
And we hold court like Mason Perry
Oops, I meant Perry Mason, the weed got me dyslexic
I’ve been hungry since I entered and I ain’t looking for an exit
Eat or get ate, and you looking like breakfast
You done took it too far, now don't stretch it
Damn, my bitch sexy
You might also like
And my bitch slutty
'Cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies, yeah
She'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Yeah, she'll do him and every one—man...

I got a bitch named Nina, and Nina so slutty
'Cause she'll do him and every one of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and every one of his buddies, yeah
She'll do him and every one of his buddies
Protection off-safety, I look straight ahead
"I got them niggas, Weezy"—that's what the .380 said
"I got them niggas, Weezy"—that's what the .380 said
That's what the .380 said, that's what the .380 said

In the back of the 'Bach
It's just me and my little brother, bitch, we call him Lil' Snack
Um, why we call him that? 'Cause he like to eat snacks
And I like to eat rappers like he like to eat snacks
I call em "emcee snacks"; you emcees wack
How 'bout your funeral? Let me emcee that! Haha
Three emcee facts:
My name's Dwayne Michael Carter—DMC's back! Hehe
Nigga, walk this way
And I'ma paint your ass like an art display
I'm really rich—I just talk this way
And maybe if you get rich, you would talk this way
See, right now I'm talking foreign, you dig? I'm talking foreign
Leave a hole in the boy big enough to park a car in
You're on, but you ain't on it—I'm mo' on like Warren
Move, boom! Now my bitch talking for me
Damn, and she's so slutty
'Cause she'll do him and every one of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and every one of his buddies
Man, she'll do him and every one of his buddies

Got a bitch named Nina, and Nina so slutty
She'll do him and every one of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and every one of his buddies, yeah
She'll do him and every one of his buddies

Protection off-safety, I look straight ahead
"I got them niggas, Weezy"
"I got them niggas, Weezy"
"I got them niggas, Weezy"
That what Weezy Baby said
Haha
You got something to tell me?2Embed
