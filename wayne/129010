Man, I told you I gotta do me, shawty
Say, what's up with all them people 'round here?
Man, I told you them niggas was wiggin' off them pills 'round here

What boy was this?
Man, you know that bitch used to be swingin' 'round the block in all them whips, bitch thinkin' he Stunna and shit
Man, ain't that cold? What you 'bout to get into?
Man, I'm gon' listen to Tha Carter II, fuck this bullshit
