5 ContributorsHeavenly Father Lyrics
Heavenly Father
Creator of all things
I fumbled and said
Was about to become
Heavenly Father

Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take
For goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take

Lord forgive me for the killings in the past
All the corrupt business' and dealings that I had
All these pregnant ladies that I served up on the Ave
Have me feel like I'm Bishop when I held my first gat
They killed Tom right in front of his home
They even murked Skee in my MPV
So I dropped to my knees, why it couldn't be me?
Why you had to leave me here with all this ENVY?
Even though I got freedom I feel like I ain't free
Everybody dying trying to be something they can't be
A couple hundred million is something we'll never see
So we speeding crashing head first into a tree
You might also like
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take
For goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take

I paid niggas' rents, even paid niggas' bails
Gave niggas jobs so they wouldn't go to jail
Did so much dirt niggas knew I wouldn't tell
Paid for some funeral they probably went to hell
I don't owe nobody nothing man, I gave that bitch a mill
I ain't beating around the bush, I'm just speakin on what's real
I ain't talking on no bullshit man, I'm talking 'bout what's real
I ain't justifying beatings well she cheated on my nills
Cheated with his brother, goddamn this bitch ill
Probably the reason my nigga never left the will
Things you'd never know have mercy on his soul
Big Pun, one of the most realest I ever known

Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take
For goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take
When I die know they bury me a G
Don't cry for me just let a nigga be
In other words let your nigga rest in peace
I been going so hard and I barely got sleep
Lord, I know my mamma gunna take my passing hard
But let her know in these streets her little boy was God
Last of the Mohicans I was taking motherfuckers hearts
Many wars you can see it in the bullet scars
Lord, can you forgive me for my sins?
Let me fly with you help a nigga spread his wings
Azarya you forever be my Queen
Just know for now daddy had to go and meet the King

Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take
For goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord for a soul to keep
And If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord for a soul to take1Embed
