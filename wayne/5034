Yo soy todo para ti, (im everything for you)
Todo lo que tu quieres esta aqui, (everything u want is here)
Te tengo conmigo (i have you with me)

Uh, yeah
Lloyds song killer
She’s my pusha
She’s my dealer
Yeah
It’s the Lloyds song killer
She’s my pusha
She’s my dealer
And this is your Wayne on drugs
I’ll be running round getting high on love
Too much will kill ya, I know that's right
But she got that crack and I got that pipe
Now if shes the pusha and I’m the hustla
And loves the drug and this for the lovers
Uh, one time for the boys in the streets with it
But me and shorty we be hustling in the sheets with it
She selling up, buy it and only when the drugs are done I feel like dying
She dope she bad
I think I'mma have to go rehab
You might also like
You're my pusha
Girl you got the world
But I wanna try
Don't wanna break the rules but I get high off your supply
Don't make me wait
I'll do what it takes
Your love is the fix I wanna taste

Her love is like cocaine cocaine
I'm flying on a private plane
And I'm so high(so high, so high, I sail in the sky)
Cobain, Cobain
She blows my brain
I'm trippin', I'm rollin'
I'm losing all control cause
She's my pusha, pusha
She's my pusha pusha
Girl she's my pusha, pusha
Pusha, pusha
She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love
I'm lifted baby
Your love is ecstasy
Everytime I'm with ya baby
I relapse and I OD
I'm addicted to you
Keep coming back for more
Never took a trip like this before


A, she supplies my unitive, if I wanna move slow
She supplies that need
If I want to go fast she provides my speed
Ha body smoking like when I light my trees
And everybody know how much I like my trees
She got me higher than the weed spot
Somebody call Dr. Dre I need detox
Man, she so dope she make my veins shiver
If I got a headache then she my pain killa
One sniff of her have my nose wide open
One hit of her have my whole mind frozen
A female eat pill wow I'm rolling
