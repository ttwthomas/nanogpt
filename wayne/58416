7 ContributorsFuck Today Lyrics

Sitting on my porch, sippin’ on Jim Beam
Read the newspaper, man, guess what I seen
Shit bad enough to make a grown man scream
And then I woke up, it's not a bad dream
Eh, I don’t really wanna talk about it
Cause every time I talk about it, I go off about it
And every time I get like that, I wanna start somebody
This world really got you thinking that you on somebody
So what, you got a gun, I don’t give a fuck about it
I would take every bullet and every buck up out it
So, motherfucker, cock it back and please buck away
Cause right now I’m feeling fuck you

And fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
I say fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today

Don’t you see that this whole world is my stage
And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking away, but we don’t care what they say
I'ma take this shit day by day

Man, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning
And my tank on E, plus the gas prices soaring
Baby momma trippin', tryna get me for my money
Now she laughing to the bank and ain't a damn thing funny
My momma lights off and my daddy don’t call
And my nigga got killed, man damn, I miss my dawg
The landlord buggin' and the rent keep coming
And the heater broke, I gotta warm my house with the oven
Every time I think about it, man, it get depressing
And the stock market down, the whole country in recession
Plus the cops got a warrant out, they trying to arrest me
Man, this whole day startin' to stress me, nigga so

Fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be a'ight, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
So fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be a'ight, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today

Don’t you see that this whole world is my stage
And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking away, but I don’t care what they say
I'ma take this shit day by day

Okay, these are the days, the days of our lives
Well, do you have a calender because I lost mine
Uh, I lost mine, uh, I lost mine
I’m the sickest virus on and offline
Imaginary line, you don’t wanna cross mine
Found a clock in the street, I’m making up for lost time
Third eye blind but it’s still fuck the bullshit
Knowing what I got but more conscience of what I could get
Tired of the same shit, don’t know who to blame, shit
And we knew a black President wouldn’t change shit
Money still a language, well ain't nobody talkin’
They found my calendar in the garbage, so

Fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
I say fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today
Cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today

Don’t you see that this whole world is my stage
And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking that shit
We gon have to see what I did
Cause I don’t give a fuck about it
And I don’t give a shit about you
I don’t give a damn about you
And I don’t give a shit about you
Motherfuck you, motherfuck me

And fuck today, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Hey, fuck today, hey, fuck today
Hey, fuck today, hey, fuck today
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay
Fuck everything gon be alright, fuck okay

Sitting on my porch, sippin’ on Jim Bean
Read the newspaper, man, guess what I seen
Shit bad enough to make a grown man scream
And then I woke up, it's not a bad dream
