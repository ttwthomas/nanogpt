39 ContributorsDipset Lyrics
Oh, yeah
Cut the music up in the phones, Drew
My hair is blocking 'em
My shit growin' like my money (The Runners!)
Haha! Let's go
Yessir!

I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!

Uh... I'm so DipSet, DipSouth Baby
If you don't like it, nigga, fuck you with a AIDS dick
I hope you die 30 times, nigga, murder moms
No fast talk, I'm on that syrup, I'm on that turtle-time
If Killa say the nigga dead, then a nigga dead
If Stunna say the nigga dead, then a nigga dead
VIP, we be then niggas banging in the red
Don't drink Cristal no more, just pour it on white bitches' heads
This ain't no Tommy Hilfiger, this that Polo, ho
We are the biggest group alive to get that solo dough
And we gon' get that dough until they say there's no more dough
I smoke a ounce, I got that bounce, I got that pogo flow
Just shot a video with R-uh Kelly, but no homo, though
Really didn't wan' do it, but I fuck with T.S. and Fat Joe-Joe though
I am a robot, and this robot is on overload
And bitch, I always will be hot like I'm an overcoat
You might also like
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!

Um... Dollar after dollar, holler at your guala
I'm rolling like the Stones, I need a water bottle
And if you need a pill, T-Streets and Carter got 'em
Supply the whole party, we got the party popping
We in New Orleans popping, we way in Harlem popping
In California popping
Them Ed Hardy-rocking skinny whores with all them problems
Bitch, you can eat these pills and chill and tell me all about 'em, shit...
Hold up, my heart is knocking, don't worry. water stops it
Hold up, your mouth is dry, don't worry, water mops it
I got a great idea: We should have sex
Bitch, I'm like Dante Hall: I just throw up the X
My dick be still hard, I be so up for next
That's when you slip up and fuck around, and fuck your ex
That be that bullshit, but it's the fucking best!
I get her to pop a pill, and come and fuck the set
And I fucking rep!
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!
I get on extra grind, when it's reppin' time
When it's reppin' time, when it's— when it's— Reppin' DipSet!
