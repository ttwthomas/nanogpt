5 ContributorsDeadliest Catch Lyrics
She want my pants
She want my boxer draws
I’m at her door
I’m ’bout to knock her off
She’s not my whore
She’s not my bitch at all
She’s more
More than y’all

I don’t recall ever feeling this way before (oh no noo)
And if I fall, hope I land on your bedroom floor (ooohh yeahh)

Hey, I’ll be the one with the yacht waiting by the shore, for sure (now play)
Hey, she wears the shoes that allows her to walk on the stars
That’s when I pulled up in my spaceship and told her we could ride to Mars
She said…

I don’t recall ever feeling this way before (ohh)

I said I hope you fall and land on my bedroom floor (ohhhooo)
I’ll be the one with the yacht waiting by the shore (oohh, now play, uh!)
Mackkkk

Meet me at the Shore Club, come get my for sure love
I’ll be in the pent house, room service bring my grub
Surf and turf baby, lobster and shrimp
I’m a Mack baby girl, no I’m not a pimp
Skirt and shirt, she outta them
Cause I’m a Mack baby girl, no I’m not a pimp
Valle bring my whip, salsa time it’s time to dip
Take her sexy ass straight to the show and let her board my ship

Fallen, fallen, I think that I’m falling
Someone threw the rug underneath my feet
Catch me, catch me, deadly if you let me
Sink way to the bottom, come pull me out

She want my pants
She want my boxer draws
I’m at her door
I’m ’bout to knock her off
She’s not my whore
She’s not my bitch at all
She’s more
More than y’all (heyy)
He wants my pants
He wants what’s in my bra
I’m at his door
I’m ’bout to break him off
He’s not a whore
He’s not a dog at all
He’s more
More than y’all
I don’t recall ever feeling this way before (oohhh yeahh)
And if I fall, hope I land on your bedroom floor (ohhh yeaa)1Embed
