25 ContributorsWe Back Soon Lyrics
Holiday season, ayy
Holid-Holid-Holid-Holid-Holid-Holiday season
Holiday season 
Sitting in my Bugatti, thinking about money
I got paid Friday, I be counting til Monday
Bullshit fly by me, I'm ducking all the bad vibes
Louis on my body and up on my damn eyes
Don't you..
Holiday season, bitch!
Holiday season

Sit in my Bugatti, thinking about money
I got paid Friday, I be counting til Monday
Bullshit fly by me, I'm ducking all the bad vibes
Louis on my body and up on my damn eyes
Don't you ever try me, I'll murk whoever dare try
Shoot you 10 times just in case you got 9 lives
Yeah, I wet you up there getting baptized
It's Weezy Baby - but it's YOUR naptime, hahah
I told you I'mma fool with it
More classier than a school with it
Now watch me ball like Rasual with it
And if it's broke, let the Pro Tools fix it
You might also like
I heard you got that good, ready for the take-off
Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off
To another World, right next to that white moon
Fly in the sky, tell em we’ll be back soon

Uh, now go hard on em Tune
White diamonds around the ruby look like Mars on the Moon
Heavy like driving loads on them bitches
Like a flower and a Phantom
Top rose on them bitches
No bullshit, no Derrick Rose on them bitches
My niggas bring me them bitches with no clothes on them bitches
I promise I do 2's 3's and 4's on them bitches, man
I do everything but propose to them bitches
Soo Woo to the Eastside
Cooker on my waist leave you bitch ass deep-fried
If I don't shoot you, you gon' get beat by it
Young M-O-N-E-Y, uh

I heard you got that good, ready for the take-off
Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off
To another World, right next to that white moon
Fly in the sky, tell em we’ll be back soon
I am not a human being
I am every woman's dream
I am a lion, no, a lion king
I'm fly, no, I'm flier with my giant wings
I sin with a grin
I sit a mac 10 on your chin
I spit out a grenade pin
I'm a soldier put in the army of made men
Yeah, ow drop it like it's hot, ho
And don't forget the baby like the motherfuckin octomom
Lock, load, bomb
The fireman bitch, it's stop, drop, roll time, yeah

I heard you got that good, ready for the take-off
Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off
To another World, right next to that white moon
Fly in the sky, tell em we’ll be back soon
I heard you got that good, ready for the take-off
Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off
To another World, right next to that white moon

Ready for the take-off
Ready for the take-off
Ready for the take-off
Ready for the take-off5Embed
