Another one
Yeah, I stay down with my day-one niggas
And we in the club, screamin'

No new friends, no new friends
No new friends, no, no new (DJ Khaled)
Still here with my day-one niggas
So you hear me say no new friends
No new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I still ride with my day-one niggas
I don't really need no new friends
No new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one, so I say
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
One more time
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, stay down from day one, so I say
(Fuck a fake friend! Where your real friends at? Started!)

Man, this shit so ill that we had to restart it
H-town my second home like I'm James Harden
Money counter go *brrrr* when you sellin' out the Garden
Four-car garage, pornstar ménage
Birdman go *brrrr* 'cause he know this shit retarded
Fuck her on the floor 'fore we make it to the bed
That's what yo' ass really call started from the bottom
Yes, Lord, OVO Sound, man, I'm proud of my niggas
Knew that we would make it, never doubted my niggas
All my bitches love me; if I had a baby mama
She would probably be richer than a lot of you niggas
Ayy, that's luxury, dawg
Day-one niggas, man, y'all stuck with me, dawg
Ever since YouTube, niggas been callin' me the leader of the new school; fuck with me, dawg, yeah

No new friends, no new friends
No new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day-one niggas
So you hear me say no new friends
No new friends, no new friends, no, no new (Let's ride)
I still ride with my day-one niggas
I don't really need no new friends
No new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one, so I say
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
One more time
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas (Maybach)
Fuck all y'all niggas, stay down from day one, so I say

Your bitch all in my photographs
Ho niggas got hate for me
Big homies all certified
Nothin' niggas gon' take from me
Follow codes, study game
Feed fam, nigga, fuck fame
All black, my whip foreign
These bad hoes keep tiptoein'
Down in Turks and Caicos
Dope boy, that's my dress code
All I hug is blood, nigga
Khaled, that's my flesh, ho
All I want is love, nigga
Money bring that stress though
Smoke good, I love life
Strip club like e'ry night
E'ry night my same niggas
Day one, straight menace (Rozay!)
No new friends, no new friends
No new friends, no, no new (Huh, Maybach Music)
Still here with my day one niggas
So you hear me say no new friends
No new friends, no new friends, no, no new (Let's ride)
I still ride with my day one niggas
I don't really need no new friends
No new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one, so I say (Let's go)
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
One more time
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, stay down from day one, so I say
(Fuck a fake friend! Where your real friends at?)

Ugh, I'm here with my niggas
I'm too high to be friendly
They throw dirt on my name
Well, that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hatin'
I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies
I wish we could trade places
Bitch, we good-fellas
Boy, all them niggas with you, they just pall bearers
And if we ball, catch us
Remember sip slow, live fast
Young Money, stay young
I been Cash Money since day one (Tunechi!)
No new friends, no new friends (Khaled fuck wit me)
No new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas
So you hear me say no new friends (Sue em)
No new friends, no new friends, no, no new (Let's ride)
I still ride with my day one niggas
I don't really need no new friends
No new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one, so I say
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas (Uh) except my niggas
One more time
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, stay down from day one, so I say

Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck them other niggas
'Cause I'm down for my niggas81Embed
