7 ContributorsSo Sharp Lyrics
I stay sharp yeah Mack diamond so sharp that's me
I mean you know my money grown but I stay sharp
I pull up looking like new money still so crisp so fly
Hoppin outta the latest whatever you know what it is let's go
 {x2}
I got the hottest cars I rock the flyest clothes
I keep the baddest hoes they fresh from head to toe
Yeen know? Sharp
Hell ya! Sharp
Yeen know?  Sharp
Hell ya!

Now check my pedigree my bloodline is purebred
My champagne is rose cause the color is more red
My pockets like skin when I whip they swell up (money)
Those 26 inches fill the wheel well up (fresh)
You can catch me in the winter with a mink on my shoulders
I like everything big so my diamonds like boulders
And yeah I had every kinda roadster or rover
Cause I love the fast lane like a supercharged motor
And I'm so damn hood like gold Daytons on a regal
But in '09 I gotta dime on the back of a screamin eagle
Big chicken hawk make it hard spin it in the pot
And now it's millions every year whether albums drop or not
See Mack 10 LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like

My crease so sharp
My shoes so red
My nigga sold geek come get your free throw tagged
My bitch so fine, I gets mo' head
Her ass so large I need a king size bed
Now that this trap so hot, we gotta write raps
All the DJ's love to play it cause I gotta write rap
Mack 10's so trill
Mack's so real
Mac 10's in the trunk, double M's on the grill
Triple gold on my caprese
My foe's all deceased
I walk so slow with a sharp ass crease
California smoker
Calico toter
Wear the wrong color you get the super soaker motherfucker


I pass up in it and it be like "What it do?"
All red to my feet but my diamonds clear blue
Nothing like the police in a Porsche 911
Stunting up that stairway to heaven
And I'm evidently not you and nothing like ya
If I was a dog I wouldn't bite ya
Nor I'm not beside ya
Boy I'm way in front of ya
You ain't even see me
Yeah I'm way gone but you ain't even leaving
Drugs beating me up I'm fighting for my life
And if you want that pussy beat then I'm Mike Tyson for tonight
Suck me up and don't you bite I don't need Mike Tyson here tonight
My blood type is like a knife mothafucka I'm sharp
