6 ContributorsThe Lost Carter IV Song LyricsJay-Z:
Turn the muthafuckin music up
Yeahhh
Yeaaaahhh!
I got these niggas Weezy!
Heheheheheheheheheheh....
You might cop a watch like mine, homie, but this a different BEZel
We both floatin on our yachts homie, but this a different VESssssel
The one ya boy ridin on is a little bit more SPESH-ull
Cos we both be gettin dough, but homie, Hov makes bigger PRETZels
OH.....We ain't count-in the same DEC-i-mals
Listen, my nigga, we ain't even speakin the same DEC-i-bels
Thought I told ya'll niggas that this rap shit was my BITCH, fam
Plus I 'ready told ya'll, I'm not a HITman, I'm a HIT, maaaaaan
Pokerface'd the game n now I'm steady stackin CHIPS, man
Use ta FLIP grams, but then it EXpand-ed, SHIT man, look what I WITH-stand-ed
Damn....Tell me WHO in HIStory did it like THIS man
The Beatles before they DISbanded, maybe MJ, maybe PRINCE man
You might also likeEven Elvis had to BOW DOWN, when his CROWN BOUNCED, look what they FOUND OUT
That boy Young ain't the one you COUNT OUT, let's see THAT from a lil nigga DOWN SOUTH
Niggas talkin breezy n run outta breath n get weezy
Thinkin those messages is for themmm jus because they been gettin cc'ed
You wanna BATTLE dog? Fuck that, lets compare catalogs...
Compare bank accounts, compare travel logs, compare passports, n THEN have a talk
Niggas think they got bite, jus cos they have a bark
Cos the niggas who ain't got cars will tell you they rather walk...Haa!
Yall niggas is avatars....to be honest, I ain't even mad at ch'all
You pour ya cup n mafuckas jus rather grab a straw.....
They like fiends, the way they rock back n forth
Like that's a cure...HUH
Niggas can't act mature.....
N everybody think they TU-pack Shakurs
Niggas brave after two packs a Coors, Two packs? OF COURSE
Triple entendre you bastards off
Soon as our mafuckin paths have crossed
Who you tryna renegade? You just a Asher Roth
Never pushed out the game due to lack a force
Plus my nigga Wayne jus adds support....HUH
