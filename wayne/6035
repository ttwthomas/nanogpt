Hey heh, hey heh
I’m gettin’ money on the streets
Hey
You niggas don’t know how to eat
Hey
Brrrrr-r-r-eh-eh-eh-eh
I turn a dime into a dollar
If you know how to hustle nigga holla
Hey
Brrrrr-r-r-eh-eh-eh-eh
I do it how I does it
I get it from my cousin
I'm buzzin
Brrrrr-r-r-eh-eh-eh-eh
And you know who I am
Neighborhood dealer man
Understand
Brrrrr-r-r-eh-eh-eh-eh
Homie it don’t really matter what you say
Say eh, say eh, say eh
Bitch I’m gettin money

We the business
Coming through shining
Blew a couple of hundreds
Big Tyming all the time, nigga been stuntin
Pearl white Maybach, nigga spent a mill
Bugatti for 2, on the hill
Shining with my strap in my right pocket
Hundred thousand a day on that sky rocket
From round the block doing this shit round the clock
Million dollar nigga doing this shit non-stop
Swagged out, big dogging on a private flight
Popping bottles, celebrating living life
Blowing big, freelander down the sand
YMCMB nigga, rich gang

Tell em hatin’ niggas miss me with that hatin’ shit
And tell them bitches, my dick got a waiting list
I ain’t trippin nigga I’m just taking trips
Put the money on the trampoline and make it flip
Young Mack, stupid Macknupid
I just bought a coupe, the roof is translucent
Pockets on etcetera, Money talk bullsh-t, walk like George Jefferson
Virgins they ain't fucking with us
Young Money Cash Money
Fuck them other niggas

It’s Tunechi baby, the money man
The money talks, now I understand
That chopper make a nigga do the running man
I would take a girl and turn her pussy to a punching bag
I’mma stunt my ass off, bitch thats word to Stunna man
School these bitch ass niggas, you are undergrad
The World is in my hand, smack the shit out you with my other hand
Young Money, Cash Money, welcome to Wonderland
