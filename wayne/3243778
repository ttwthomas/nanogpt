Yup, oh yeah
D.O.L.L.A

Aye, run it up, run it, aye, run it up, aye
I'ma get the check and I'ma run it up, aye (run it)
I'ma get the squad and we gon' run it up, aye (run it)
All of this is hustle, none of this is love, aye
Run it up, aye, run it, run it up, aye
I'ma get the check and I'ma run it up, aye
I'ma get the squad and we gon' run it up (squad!), aye
All of this is hustle, none of this is love
They was hatin' on me, now it's all love
All of this is hustle, none of this is love
We was goin' hard, now we came up
All of this is hustle, none of this is love

Aye, all of this is hustle
Y'all about to make it where I gotta show my muscle
When I'm gettin' to it, girl, it's easier to love you
Tried to give me scraps, I made 'em pieces to the puzzle
I grind
Ain't no secret money on my mind
Sit at my table then you want my time
And I don't play that
I'm stuntin' for the payback
I'm from where Golden State at
But Portland where I lay at
I'm the Daddy Mac, Mac Daddy with hoop and rappin'
Y'all be on your Kris Kross, uh, hustlin' backwards
All this game I'm givin' is prolly gon' be a caption
When the lights and camera off I'ma still be 'bout that action
You might also like
Aye, run it up, run it, aye, run it up, aye
I'ma get the check and I'ma run it up, aye
I'ma get the squad and we gon' run it up, aye
All of this is hustle, none of this is love, aye
Run it up, run it, aye, run it up, aye
I'ma get the check and I'ma run it up, aye
I'ma get the squad and we gon' run it up (squad!), aye
All of this is hustle, none of this is love
They was hatin' on me, now it's all love
All of this is hustle, none of this is love
We was goin' hard, now we came up
All of this is hustle, none of this is love

Aye, I'm finna run it up
And tell them niggas hurry up if niggas runnin' up
Them haters try to bring me down, I shouldn't have brung 'em up
She askin' me to bring her out, I only brung a blunt
Run it up, we runnin' things, she want run with us (yeah)
Yada, yada, young mula, now kiss my such and such
I want a thot, I want a model with a bubble butt
A double cup of some codeine and my slushy slush
Pullin' stunts, I'm pullin' strings, and I'm pullin' up
I spun it up and bounced back like a bungee jump
And D. Lill. in the buil', nigga one of us
Them D. Lills on my feet after 1-on-1
Aye, run it up, run it, aye, run it up, aye
I'ma get the check and I'ma run it up, aye
I'ma get the squad and we gon' run it up, aye
All of this is hustle, none of this is love, aye
Run it up, run it, aye, run it up, aye
I'ma get the check and I'ma run it up, aye
I'ma get the squad and we gon' run it up (squad!), aye
All of this is hustle, none of this is love
They was hatin' on me, now it's all love
All of this is hustle, none of this is love
We was goin' hard, now we came up
All of this is hustle, none of this is love

They know what's up whenever we roll, ugh
D.O.L.L.A. with the movement, the party go, "ugh"
All of this is hustle, none of this is love
Know what time it is, they don't frisk my cousins
We be on chill, we ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Baby, if it's real, then it's no discussion
I ain't tryna hear what you tryna tell me (uh-uh)
I ain't tryna buy what you tryna sell me, uh
I see the hatred, how that paint drip
Closed another deal, hunnid mill', uh, page flip
We gon' run it up, Cartier bracelet
I could make a princess chick out of basic
They was hatin' on me, now it's all love
All of this is hustle, none of this is love
We was goin' hard, now we came up
All of this is hustle, none of this is love, aye
Run it up, run it, aye, run it up, run it
I'ma get the check and I'ma run it up, aye
I'ma get the squad and we gon' run it up, aye
All of this is hustle, none of this is love, aye
Run it up, run it, aye, run it up, run it, aye
I'ma get the check and I'ma run it up, aye
I'ma get the squad and we gon' run it up, aye
All of this is hustle, none of this is love, aye5Embed
