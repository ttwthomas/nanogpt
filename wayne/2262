6 ContributorsCascades LyricsShe say “what’s happening?”
I say “wassup wassup”
She ask “whats up with me”
I say “whats up with us”
I say “what’s really good?”
I say “what’s really good?”
I put my love down
She say “it’s really good”
She say “it’s feeling good”
I say “I’m feeling better”
I make her say my name in Capital Letters
I’m a nasty guy
Dont ask me why
Just ask me how and I’ll show you proud
Her head is gone, she’s in the clouds
And when she rains, man she pours down
And I be the fella without an umbrella
Ma, you finer than a wine cellarYou might also like2Embed
