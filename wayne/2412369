10 ContributorsHalfway (Remix) Lyrics
She meet me halfway
And this the remix that say they featuring Tunechi
This is the remix baby, remix
Yeah, this is the remix baby
Oh yeah, yeah, this is the remix baby, remix
See I got your back

Oh baby, you are the only one I adore
You are the only one I have love for
I promise you, I'll be all you need
As long as you can work with me girl
You are the wish that I have been wishing for
You are the one that I have been longing for
I'll be real with you just be real with me
And I will love you eternally

Just meet me halfway girl
We can do this thing for the longest
I'll be loving on you for the longest
You'll be loving on me for the longest girl
Just meet me halfway and I'll be here to stay
Just meet me halfway girl
We can do this thing for the longest
I'll be loving on you for the longest
You'll be loving on me for the longest girl
Just meet me halfway and I'll be here to stay

Uh, time's getting harder and these bitches want a baller
But I'm getting harder, and I'm getting better
And I'm getting smarter (yes) and Lil Hoody is getting smaller
No time for these hoes, I don't wanna be bothered (oh no)
If she ain't Misses Carter, yeah, if she can't cook a quarter
Like 9-1-1 don't call her, if she ain't with the shit though
I stop being so friendly bitch get ghost
But see you, you been down from the get-go
Way before I went blond like Sisqó
And when I want it bad you become a nympho
Wearing nothing but heels and a trench coat
And when I tell you do something you say "ten four"
I ain't fuckin' with these other hoes they're a shit show
I'm in love with my new bae, yeah, that's my new bae
She do what I say and always meet me halfway
Oh yeah, lay up for a day or two, on a beach, no bathing suit
Favor for favor, sixty-nine, numbers don't lie, that's true

Just meet me halfway girl
We can do this thing for the longest
I'll be loving on you for the longest
You'll be loving on me for the longest girl
Just meet me halfway and I'll be here to stay
Just meet me halfway girl
We can do this thing for the longest
I'll be loving on you for the longest
You'll be loving on me for the longest girl
Just meet me halfway and I'll be here to stay
And it is  a 2 way street
To make this thing work
But I know we gon' have our problems
But we gon' work together to solve em girl
I just want you to know
I'mma take you for ya flaws even though ya perfect
I'll answer your calls every time you're working
Even when you down I will be the reason that you smile again, smile again

Just meet me halfway girl
We can do this thing for the longest
I'll be loving on you for the longest
You'll be loving on me for the longest girl
Just meet me halfway and I'll be here to stay
Just meet me halfway girl
We can do this thing for the longest
I'll be loving on you for the longest
You'll be loving on me for the longest girl
Just meet me halfway and I'll be here to stay

She do what I say and always meet me halfway
And this the remix S-8ighty featuring Tunechi
Yeah, this the remix, the remix babyEmbed
