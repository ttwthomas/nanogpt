Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
A drop top, flip flop, shine thats the chrome glow
Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song go
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
A drop top, flip flop, shine thats the chrome glow
Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song go
Rubber burnin
Yea yea yea yea we keep that
Rubber burnin
Yea yea yea yea we stayin'
Drop top, flip flop, shine thats the chrome glow
Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song go

Straight off the lot's how I get mine
Pick mine
Car clean lookin' like it just been spit shined
24 inches on his rims big
Bout the size of a 2 year old kid (ya digg)
Plus, U-turnin' in that S550
Look like I'm U-turnin' in a jet
Why did he do that
When he just came through
Why did he come back
I'm just frontin' how you, how you?
Diva on my side while the tires burnin'
I be burnin'
I'm schoolin' these niggas that's what you call higher learning
So listen up grab a chair, have a seat
Crack a beer, smoke a blunt
Watch me the captains here
Louis Vuitton sneaks on the pedal
Do 100 for a mile like my feet went to sleep on the pedal
And no longer am I gonna pop tags off my clothes
Dudes need to know I spent big cash on my clothes
No cash on my hoes, just pass all my hoes
To my niggas let 'em hit it then they get passed on some mo'
Got my system amped up and it's rattling the trunk
Niggas know how I get down they just glad it ain't the pump
Bangin'

Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
A drop top, flip flop, shine thats the chrome glow
Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song go
Rubber burnin
Rubber burnin
Drop top, flip flop, shine thats the chrome glow
Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song go

Yeah, I can't feel my face
Cocky in the coupe but they love it
Sittin' on buttons, a pair of 20 somethings
Tires so skinny like I'm sitting on nothing
Leather so soft like I'm sitting on muffins
Beating up the block knocking pictures off the wall
Baby I can drop the top and we can talk to the Lord
And you know I got the stash spot, not!
Cause where I'm from you need your gats out, and cocked
Yea, back out the driveway spoiler banging
I'm shittin' on 'em need toilet training
A big baller can't guard me baby, I mean it
Why the girls gotta double team me
Sittin' sideways yea I'm leanin', I go hard
20 G's in each back pocket 'case I fall
I'm stuntin' check my past I get that cash
In the Phantom with Louisiana plates on the ass
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
A drop top, flip flop, shine thats the chrome glow
Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song go
Rubber burnin
Rubber burnin
Drop top, flip flop, shine thats the chrome glow
Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song goEmbed
