5 ContributorsPiano Man Lyrics
Heyyyy
Yeahhhhh

Ok I saw you at the bus stop
You had on a halter top
And your mini skirt
And your doony in your purse
So I turn around and swoop you
And hit you with that toot toot
Like do you need a ride
Like do you need a ride
Cause I know where your from
Your from where I'm from
Then I'm with you girl
I know you girl
I like you girl
I want you
I'm from where your from
And I'm cool with your mom
I like you girl

I with your girl
I'm for you girl

You're my around the way girl (ohhhh)
You're my around the way girl (ohhhh ohhh)

I saw you at the benz lot
In that new benz drop
Looking at that benz drop
So I bought you that benz drop
So now you in that new coupe
Hit me with that toot toot
Like girl I need a ride
Like girl I need a ride
Because you know where I'm from

And I'm with your girl

Your from where I'm from
And your cool with my mom
And I know you
