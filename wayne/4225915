2 ContributorsKnockout! LyricsHey, Barbie, are-are-are are you into black men?
Hey-hey-hey, hey, Barbie!
Hey, I could be your black Ken (Wow!)
Cause once you go black, you never go back
She wear her hair black, with curls in the back
Then she threw that ass back back back
Then I fell to the mat
And after that, everything went black
Baby, one-two-three, tell 'em get the referee
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)
Get the telephone please, it's an emergency
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)
Hey, Barbie, can I call you Barbara
Hey,Barbie, yeah can I call you tomorrow and today
Cause once you go black, you never go back
And when she go to Wayne, everybody else is whack
The she threw that ass back back back, then I fell to the mat
And after that, everything went black
Baby, one-two-three, tell 'em get the referee
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)
Get the telephone please, it's an emergency
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)
You might also likeAwww, fuck it! Give me that damn bucket
When when I throw this pussy you better not start duckin'
Oh, yo, hit-hit 'em with the blow
Look-look out in the crowd and everybody's yellin' no
Grab him by his locks and give us a good box
Then hit him below the belt I wanna give him good top
Top-top, give him good top
Hit him below the belt I want to give him good top
One-two-three they yellin' one-two-three
I done hit 'em with that motherfuckin' crunk two-piece
Tell 'em, tell 'em to mop out, too late to copout
Give 'em more head than toupees, that's the knockout
Baby, one-two-three, tell 'em get the referee
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)
Get the telephone please, it's an emergency
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)
So just knock me out
So just knock me out
Damn, just knock me out
So just knock me out, just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me outEmbed
