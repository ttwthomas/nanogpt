Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (let's ride, let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah
And you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Yeah, yeah!

I'm the one that hit that same spot (same spot)
She the one that bring them rain drops (rain drops)
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (hot)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (hot hot hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (yeah)
And your look's just the same without no make-up (make-up)
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (made of)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout them commas 'cause my cake up (yeah yeah)
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (skrt)
'Cause I promise, when we step out you'll be famous (yeah)
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us (why?)
'Cause when we pull up — brt-brt! — all angles (yeah)

Okay though

Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a boy that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the Dawn
Know you wanna ride now (let's ride, let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah
And you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one

Don't you know, girl? Don't you know, girl?
I am the one for you (I'm the one)
Yeah, I'm the one
Don't you know, girl? Don't you know, girl?
I am the one for you (I'm the one)
Yeah, I'm the one
Don't you know, girl? Don't you know, girl?
I am the one for you (I'm the one)
Yeah, I'm the one
Don't you know, girl? Don't you know, girl?
I am the one for you (I'm the one)
Yeah, I'm the one2Embed
