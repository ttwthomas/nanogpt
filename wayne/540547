1 ContributorPistoolloop Lyrics
I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
Yah! I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
And there's no talkin' back when my gun talk

See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk

Uh, fuck that nigga, ho ass nigga
Leave that nigga with a toe tag, nigga
Barrel so long you can pole dance, nigga
Run up in ya house, where the dope at, nigga?
Murder she wrote on a notepad, nigga
Light that nigga up, smoke that nigga
Stomp that nigga, roast that nigga
I'm walkin' 'round with this shotgun and this bitch bigger than me nigga
Don't open up yo fuckin' mouth cause I'll pull the trigger like teeth nigga
Shoot 'em up, then leave, nigga
I smell summer's eve, nigga
We shoot first, it's better to give than receive, nigga
You might also like
I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
Yah! I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
And it's no talkin' back when my gun talk

Keep that ho shit over there
And we don't shoot in the air
I can't fuck with these niggas, man these niggas gummy bears
Hair trigger on the gun, I pull that muthafucka' hair
It's like man you can't trust nobody, I don't even have a trust fund
Don't buck, nigga, don't stunt, nigga
Don't duck, nigga cause I duck hunt
Bitch rock with me, that Glock with me
That chopper with me, obviously
I'mma empty this muthafucka' - that's fifty shots, approximately
Now fuck with me, get fucked over
Emergency room: rushed over
Hollow tips, in the clip, my gun loaded: yours sober
I pull yo card like a lawn mower
Fall back or I'm goin' forward
I see you got yo gun drawn; I send you back to the drawin' board
Lil Tunechi
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk

Walkin' round this mu'fucka limpin'
Cause the nose on the pistol 'bout as long as Scottie Pippen's
On the molly and I'm twisted
Throw ya body with the fishes
Double back around that corner and I'm bodying the witness
Uh, real niggas don't talk much
Do drive by's and walk ups
Lame rappers that talk tough get a broke jaw, star struck
I don't fuck with the lame niggas
I got good aim, nigga
Pop a pill, pop you, my nick name is Pain Killer
I'm still that same nigga, Eastside I rep that
Pussy niggas better get right or where I see you, you get left at
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk
Gudda!

I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
And its no talkin' back when it go off
I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
You speechless
(When I cock back!)

See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walkEmbed
