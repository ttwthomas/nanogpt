13 ContributorsDear Lord Lyrics
Yeah
Livin' that life, livin' that life
Under them street lights
But it ain't bright enough to show me where I'm going
But I still find my way, and when I do I keep going, and I'm
A nigga with stripes
Try me and your family don't sleep right
Didn't think I was tough enough to make it on my own
But I could get through anything if I done made it through the storm, and umm
I'm killing that night, killing that night
Life on that East Side
Leather on chrome, television with the phone
And the top is so gone
I do it so right, I do it so right
They want me to be like
I'm in the zone, bad to the bone
Correct me if I'm wrong

Times is hard as it is
That's why I got guns and my guns got kids
And all I wanna do is handle my biz
And all I'm tryna do is whatever I did, Dear Lord
Everyday I've been praying to you
I hope You're hearing everything that I'm saying to You
I get money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
You might also like
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm dying to get over
And once I get over, good Lord I know
That all my drama's over
And I thank you
And I be with them niggas
And ain't none of them broke
They ride around with that rope, and they'll hang you
And leave your mama to cope
On that Holiday note
Damnnnn,Then they put a sign on the do'
Saying you don't know shit
Or else you dying in court, mannnnn
You gotta know how it go
Or else you could end up in another bump in the road
You see


A prisoner of this war
We call America
Where the President is the enemy
And he already won, damn
And Armageddon and depressions already begun
So excuse my expression
But it's my aggression
Cause I'm gonna spread you some
I know my people tired
Of all the crying, all the dying
All the time, we just trying
To get our mind off the crime and find somethin' to find
And did I mention not to mention
That my life is on the line
Give me light, and I'mma shine
Give me rope, and I'mma climb
I'm hoping that the Gates'll be open when I arrive
Until then, I'm alive
My job is to survive
So Lord, keep me in your eyes
I'm tryna say
