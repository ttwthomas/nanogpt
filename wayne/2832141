4 ContributorsBedrock Pt. II (Young Goldie Mix) Lyrics
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock girl
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock

I can beat it up like an ultimate fighter
I can eat it up like a Siberian tiger
I can heat it up like Miami in the summer
I wanna ride you out for Yokahama
Your body baby
Is shaped like my guitar
I wanna tune it up and play it all night
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Cause she wanna Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh do baby

She got that good good
She Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, For her attractive ass
And now we murderers, Because we kill time
I knock her lights out, And she still shines
I hate to see her go, But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day, hot as a summers eve
Young Money thieves, steal your heart with ease
You might also like
Ooh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flinstone I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock girl
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock

In the bed girl me be trouble
I can make your body rock me no rubble
So holla back when you see me you heard I tear that pussy up me and young jeezy it's gettin late
We can see the sun come over to my house & play on my drums brum bum bum bum give the drummer some girl here the drummer come

I Love Ya Sushi Rolls, Hotter Than Wasabi
I'm Race'n For Your Love
Shake And Bake Ricky Bobby
I'm At The W, But I Can't Meet You In The Lobby
Girl I Gotta Watch My Back, Cause I'm Not Just Anybody
I Seen Em' Stand In Line, Just To Get Beside Her
I Let Her See The Aston, And Let The Rest Surprise Her
That's When We Disappear, You Need GPS To Find Her
Oh That Was Your Girl?
I Thought I Recognized Her
Ooh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flinstone I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock girl
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock

Fast cars and pretty women got a lot in common I'm speedin in em' 
Me no rubble

Ooh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the key spot
Call me Mr. Flinstone I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock girl
I-I-I can make your bedrock
I-I-I can make your bedrock

Me no rubble
It's Young Goldie Baby Embed
