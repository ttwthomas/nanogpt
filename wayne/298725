 wants to make contact 
It’s been 72 hours since the crash
A fiery ball come clashing from the sky
Reports still show no known survivors
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
Extraterrestrials
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens

You said “I come in peace” so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen

Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet’s outside there waiting
I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
You might also like
Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn’t have a friend, didn’t know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You’re my best friend please listen to me

You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen

Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet’s outside there waiting
I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

Greetings, I fell from the sky
I’m from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And our flying saucer crashed, I’m the only one that survived
I’ve only taken over this planet since I arrived
I’m in a backpack, I’m ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I’m an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne’s world
Reports from witnesses flooded into the police station
Sounds like something out of a movie
After 
First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
UFO 
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
We found this but no one can identify it
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens

Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet’s outside there waiting
I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

In our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted
It's a gift from the mother and
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace81Embed
