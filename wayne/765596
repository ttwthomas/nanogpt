2 ContributorsMarvin’s Room (Freestyle) LyricsDana texted me and said she wanted to see me
Then sent a picture of her in the mirror
No clothes on, of course
And she want that dope dick
Hello world, I'm the dope dealer
I love it when she talk crazy, that dick make her walk crazy
That last time was awesome, all the lines, we crossed them
I ain't a killer but don't push me, I OJ Simpsoned that pussy
That's the shit, pussy taste so good make you smack your lips
I don't know about you but I'm a beast with mine
She said she wait for the Carter to 69, I told her "Sorry 4 The Wait"
I value her time like an Audemars Piguet
And we gonna stay current like the water in the lake
Yeah, we fuck around like we fucking in a circle
Pardon the slur, that's the purple, it feel so real like it's virtual
Any kind of position, she's versatile
And she take it every way except personal
Yeah, that's my bitch, pussy wetter than a wishing well
I wish I was in it right now instead of making this song
Hut one, hut two, I run it in the end zone
Don't trip when I say I can't see you
You might also likeAnd she say she working on her career
Smoke got our eyes looking like we from Korea
We floating but I'ma rock the boat like Aaliyah, R.I.P
Shorty got me
Shorty knows I fuck her with her hard body
Shorty fine by me, spend some time by me
It's a jungle out there, come and climb my tree
I know it's on your mind, fine, we can do, whatever that is
She tell me that it's fine
I said fine, shit, I was taught to live and let live
So live it up, baby, giddy up, baby
It's your world, ain't trying to interrupt but maybe
We moving too fast but fuck it, let's crash
One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past
But for now I feel lovely, I feel great
Slide in you, safe
Yeah, all that good shit
No, I ain't a player, I just play by the bush
And I know what I'm doing
She loves how I do it, she throw that ass back
And she never over-do it, she call me, 'Baby'
And I call her Bay', sorry for the wait
Carter IV on the way, August 29thEmbed
