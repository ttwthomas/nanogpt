15 ContributorsLook At Me Now (Remix) Lyrics
I don’t see how you can hate from outside of the club
You can’t even get in
Hahaha l'ego!

Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah
That shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in 10 years, in two days
Ladies love me; I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari

Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I’m getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker

Lil nigga, bigger than gorilla
Cause I’m killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said on my dick
I ain’t really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I’m done
See Chris Brown LiveGet tickets as low as $58,500You might also like
Now let a track go past like this and Twista not fuck with it
Y’all done lost your mind
Let me show y’all how I do it
Check it

I could hit you with the automatic flow
I could do any rhythm and any pattern that I wanna do, the harder that it go
You could see blood spilling out from my body right in front of you, and I'ma get the dough
Now the way I be shinin' be havin' everybody lookin' at me
Fuckin' them up when I buck and I'ma step and get off
I do a murder when I'm trigger happy (like)
I got the intricate pattern to kill 'em for currency when I be animate, I'mma be makin' ‘em holler 'cause I'ma get dollars when I'm attackin' the beat I'm a scholar 'cause I'm a personification of God so you better honor (what!?)
Mr. Immaculate, I’m gonna wreck it, a marvellous accurate lyricist
I’ll be here forever
Haters wanna hate on me because they wanna hear whatever
I could spit a rhythm to a bitch and get her pussy wetter
Pimpin' on a bitch and tell her I could get her pussy cheddar
So I get the camera then go and make a movie
Me up in the back of her, tappin' her, gets the booty
Didn’t wanna show my face even though she was a cutie
Nine millimeter and spillin' millions of milliliters of life out a nigga if he talk shit
C.E.O., step into my office
Coming with the awkward flow like I'm sick
Go get your momma to bring a thermometer
My temperature's hot
Come up with a flow that would kill a industry, and I could pick anything that I want off the lot
Never compatible 'cause I be intricate, when I be serving you
When I be doin' it at a pace, I know they can't leave me
Think Twista could kill 'em on a track
With Busta, Breezy and Weezy?
Easy!
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I’m getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker

Man, fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y’all doin’?
I’m Lil Tunechi, I’m a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don’t eat sushi, I’m the shit, no, I’m pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then I’m like olé
I don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That’s word to my flag, and my flag red
I’m out of my head, bitch I’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain’t hotter than mine, nope, not on my time and I’m not even trying
Whats poppin’ slime? Nothin’ five, and if they trippin’ fuck ‘em five
I ain’t got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight, bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddy’s dead
You faggots scared cause I’m too wild, been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
I’m so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now, bitch
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I’m getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker

Okay, okay
Is that right?
I’m fresher than a motherfucker4Embed
