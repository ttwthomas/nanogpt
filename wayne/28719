I'm on my grind, fuck bitches money on my mind
Ho get in line, respect me like a stop sign
I'm in my prime, the brights you see it's my time
But fuck my wrists I need that money in my palm
Sellin palm trees, in beaches in shorts sleeves
Fly your bitch down here bet ya she won't leave
Exspensive car keys and glasses, t-shirts, pants's
I keep money on me like dancers, see
Everybody got problems, and money is the answer
The teacher ain't pickin everybody with they hands up
What are we to do but get paid, get ya grass up
Number one fan of the money, join the fan club
These boys don't know paper like I know paper
Nigga I'm still on 2004 paper, I'm tryin to get some more paper
I ain't tryin to die with no paper, that's why a nigga stay....

First Class LV's on the luggage V-8's in the car this the life how you want it
I do it big easy does it hows I does it when I does it pretty chicks every night and we fuckin
I get paper get cash get ass later, it's money first ass later skip past haters
The brown paper bag taker, straight to the dealer, just give me paper tags i'll take her
Then, I leave out with the sun roof cracked blowin weed out, two fingers up, yup peace out
I sense money like bees sense honey like k-9 dogs sense drugs I sense it all
