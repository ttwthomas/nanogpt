104 ContributorsSenile Lyrics
High in the video, fuck with me, hella raw
Raw got a little riddle, riddle, twerk for a star
Started from the, like Christina, got a million
Man I'm a good guy, turned to a vill-i-an
Bully in the pack turned to a rat
Pussy on my jack, I hit a bitch with a car bomb
Bombs in L.A., bombs in the Bay
Nigga you ain't safe, I run with niggas like O-Dog
All we do is ball, all we do is ball, now I'm passed out
Lean in the drop, ice in the watch
Nigga, that's Ben & Jerry dollars, watch a nigga make a stack house
Gingerbread man run while you can
All you niggas lame, tooly on me, got killers on speed dial
Infrared blam if a nigga shout
Don't get packed out, prolly hit a paparazzi when I back out

Can you see now? Are you senile?
Can you see now? You could see now?
Can you see now? Can you see now?
Can you see now? When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile

Sky dweller check, helicopter pad
Droppin' off a body bag
Money talk, guess I got the gift of gab
Don't interject, don't intercept
You ain't on a jet, you ain't meet a bitch with this kinda money yet
Yeah, I got an Audemar, I ain't set the time once
And I know they say they shine, I ain't seen 'em shine once
All these rappers is my sons, and I'm always nine months
Man if this was baseball, I ain't let 'em slide once
Do you see now? You playin' D now?
Oh, you wanna beat me, how?
Oh, you the number one draft in the league now?
Ride down ya block, doors 12 o'clock
Lambo, the drop, bike niggas, ain't stoppin' for a cop
I got this shit locked tighter than a bear hug
When them bitches rap, niggas need an earplug
You might also like
Can you see now? Are you senile?
Can you see now? You could see now?
Can you see now? Can you see now?
Can you see now? When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile

Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street
Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street
Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street
Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street

Nigga, got a problem? See about it
Knock the nigga off, beat the body
I'm just makin' all these deposits
Neighborhood nice and quiet, thought I saw Mr. Rogers, nigga
I could sell salt and equalize it, wait
I said I could sell salt and equalize it
Boy, I got every award but a Heisman
Do a drive-by on you niggas, make a u-turn for survivors
Take a newborn from his momma, stick a shoe horn in vaginas
Got the coupe on Yokohamas, got the super soaker chopper
We'll kidnap the kingpin, like "Who is your supplier?"
Nigga better know the fire, nigga better know somebody
I know niggas that'll kill yah for a little notoriety
I can make a lion say "Meow"
I'm in this mothafucka gettin' money 'til I'm senile
Tunechi!
Can you see now? Are you senile?
Can you see now? You could see now?
Can you see now? Can you see now?
Can you see now? When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile
Can you see now? Are you senile?
Can you see now? You could see now?
Can you see now? Can you see now?
Can you see now? When you see a nigga, don't be actin' senile337Embed
