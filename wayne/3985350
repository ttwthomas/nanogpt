"If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be"
"You tatted your face—"
Bugatti, new boo
"You screamed, 'Suu whoop'—"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
"You bought a Bugatti—", so you can flex
"And most of the bad bitches your ex"
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo, new subject, new paper, new class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs, much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move, two eyes to view but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you? Two middle fingers that's up high to whom it may consume
Kaboom, goddamn, who knew that I am the guru with voodoo that sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man, and see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam, sit back and watch, and do not watch your watch hand, give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man, I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock, but it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans than a fuckin' rock band under a rock, man
We need Barack, man, I do what I can to keep it solid as a-- you know what I'm sayin'
With some rock playin'

"You tatted your face and changed the culture" (You changed)
"You screamed, 'Suu whoop,' and them gangsters loved you" (Yeah, yeah)
"You bought a Bugatti so you could flex" (So you can flex)
"And most of the bad bitches your ex"

I started this shit, you just part of this shit, I'm the heart of this shit, and the heart doesn't skip
Take the heart of yo' bitch, 'cause like Bart, you a simp, and your water don't drip so your garden ain't shit
You just countin' the money, I'm drownin' in money, like, "Where the fuck is the lifeguard in this bitch?"
I go Mars in this bitch, watch me orbit and shit, for the art of this shit, Andy Warhol and shit
Go retarded as shit, you go sweet, tangy, I go tart on this shit, I'ma barf on this shit
I'm a martian and shit, you an orphan, lil' bitch, if I taught you some shit, that's like Harvard, lil' bitch
You ain't talkin' 'bout shit but you softer than shit, walk it like you talk it, now you walkin' in shit
I go Marvel movie on some marvelous shit, in the spotlight too long, should be darker than this
This is Tha Carter, lil' bitch

"You tatted your face and changed the culture" (You changed)
"You screamed, 'Suu whoop,' and them gangsters loved you" (Yeah, yeah)
"You bought a Bugatti so you could flex" (So you can flex)
"And most of the bad bitches your ex"

I started this shit, they borrowed this shit, I thought of this shit, they thought it was it
I'm doggin' this shit, they bark and they sit, put a fork in that shit, which drawer to look in?
I brought in this shit, the starters get benched, the orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile, I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit in the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit 'bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit

Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo, tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
All of that shit, just Tha Carter, lil' bitch
You changed, suu whoop (You tatted your face)
Bugatti, new boo ("You screamed, 'Suu whoop'—")
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tunechi
