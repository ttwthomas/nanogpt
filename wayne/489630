11 ContributorsYou Don’t Know Weezy Lyrics
I get high, high, high, high
Word

I do this when I wanna, mama
I hustle when it;s hotter, money, gun, weed, and a water bottle
I'm the coolest in the sauna mama
I ain't sweating it, I'm betting it, I'll make it back tomorrow, Mama
I got corner honor, ain't been to court since 2004
Looks like I got it going, your honor
I'm a lone rider, grind for my own dollars
They was in front, but I'm blowing by 'em, 
I'm on hoes like cornrows, open toes
Fake titties, yes, I bought both of those
Hold your nose, I'm the shit, can't be flushed
I got the toilet stopped up, call the plumber up
My stomach stuffed—that's right, I'm eating
I smoke the best weed, look like I'm sleeping
Cook it by this evening, off it by the morning
Professional dope boy, my office is The Carter

You don't know what you're doing

Yes, I do, and I do it better than most
My competitive drive knock a nigga off the road, yeah
Lock and load, pull the triggers and roll, yeah
The bigger your mouth, the bigger the hole, yeah
We figured 'em out, them niggas is hoes
Yeah, they lawn chairs, baby, quicker to fold
But me—I'm quick on my toes, I remember the code
You need a pass for the hood, watch me get through the tolls, shit
I been through the cold, I shot through the fire
Still rock too much ice, should've got you a visor
I pull up, the bitches flock and admire
Fresh, like I just stepped out of a dryer
Yes! No fret, I got the lock of a lion
It's Eagle Street, ho, the whole block is behind me, yeah
Stay low, the cops is spying
But they could never figure out the rocket science
No pocket knife, no pocket iron, yeah
Pots and pans make the pockets wider
Dig 'em a hole, let the property hide 'em
Build a house and throw a party over your dead body
Never said I'll never fail, but never dropped an assignment
Gotta finish what you start or the cops'll find it
Dinner in the park, yeah, may seem cool
But me—I'd rather not let them see my food
I'm staying strapped like Fila shoes
Bet I bust the motherfucker 'til the enemy move, c'mon!
It's my game, nigga, get in and lose
Y'all niggas never do what I do, I do me!
