8 ContributorsEverything I Do Lyrics
Everywhere I'll be, everywhere I go, everything I do
She know I cannot get away from, I cannot get away from
Because she'll be everywhere I'll be, everywhere I go, and everything I do
She know I cannot get away from, I cannot get away from

Yeah It's big money poppin' shawty I can change your life
Take me on a trip, red carpet, 5 mics
Duffel bags full, carrots like a drump
Marbles on the floor, all red rum
Popping bottles ever night like its a normal sight
Hella choppers every time a nigga on a flight
You know I'm hustling workin' flippin' these dollars
Steppin' on hundreds, jumpin' out of the shower
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You know we on that fly shit
Mansion on that island bitch, stuntin' on my new shit
Stunting with my new bitch, riding automatic clip
Doin' it big on the grind on my uptown shit
Shinin' with my Harley shoes, brand new Bugatti nigga hard as you
Bird wings on a eagle flight
Landin' this every night, shinin' 'cuz we live bright

Everywhere I'll be, everywhere I go, everything I do
She know I cannot get away from, I cannot get away from
Because she'll be everywhere I'll be, everywhere I go, everything I do
She know I cannot get away from her, I cannot get away from her

Bitch I'm Mack Maine!
Yeah, It's like everywhere I be the bitch come around
She got a radar on that dick soon as I come in town
Go to the BET awards, she's two seats down
She be there as soon as I put two feet down
On the ground, soon as I get off the jet
My name ain't Keith, so bitch you ain't gonna make me sweat
Fuck around and get left ho, if you get hit with this right ho
Fuck around and make me do what they say OJ did to that white ho
You psycho, stalker, but I ain't runnin' no Hershel Walker
Comin' off in that water, get more then restrainin' orders
Look you outta respect me goin' to the altar
No opera, either your mother and father say they don't understand, they outta
But despite this bullshit look stay on the grind
Visit my crib because I stay on her mind
Funny how they say love don't cost a thing, but I see the bitch pay all the time
I told her bitch you need to skedaddle, I can't escape the bitch like my shadow
I told her ride on with no saddle, I'm up shits creek with no paddle

Everywhere I'll be, everywhere I go, everything I do
She know I cannot get away from, I cannot get away from
Because she'll be everywhere I'll be, everywhere I go, everything I do
She know I cannot get away from her, I cannot get away from her
Banana Kush, Yeah, Yeah
Birdman, five star, starting with that lick read
YMCMB, hundred bees
A hell of a combo money and swag, swag and money, livin' lavish
I'm bout my business, business Money over bitches
Riches on my riches, I been about my digits
Grindin' to the finish, no divin', crossin' fences
Hustlin' til we get it we shinin' because we flip it
Pearl white Lambo with no top on it
She like my style so she rockin' on it
Red ribbon OT she went major on it
Milk and cookies, she gettin' cake on me

Everywhere I'll be, everywhere I go, everything I do
She know I cannot get away from, I cannot get away from
Because she'll be everywhere I'll be, everywhere I go, everything I do
She know I cannot get away from her, I cannot get away from her2Embed
