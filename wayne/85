Woo! Roxanne!
It's Kells, bitches (Owwwww!)
You don't have to turn off the red light
Hahah, chyeah! (Scotty) Chyeah!
I'm in the building! (Let's make it rain on these niggas)
I see you Joey (Crack) Remix!

Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella (Remix!)
I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this bitch with the Terror (We The Best)
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella (Let's go!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
Make it rain on them hoes (Remix!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Remix!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (We The Best)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Listennn!)
Oww!
You might also like
I be drillin' these chicks like Major Payne
When I make it rain, they be like, "Kells, do it again!" (Oh!)
From the club to the coupe, inside my gates
Up in my bedroom, screamin' each others' names (Oh! Ugh)
They was purrty-purrty, and I was flirty-flirty
Lil' dro, lil' bub, now they gettin' dirty-dirty
Don't ask me what my name is—stupid bitch, I'm famous
You gon' make me aim this, leave your ass brainless
I'm tryin' to stay R&B, but these streets is a part of me
So don't get it twisted!
You see, I order one bottle, then I fuck with one model
Then I order more bottles; now, I got more models
I'm from that city where them niggas don't play, man
I take a chick to my room like caveman
So ask your girlfriend my name, I bet she go:
"Skeet-skeet-skeet-skeet, weatherman 'bout to make it rain!"

Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror (Remix!)
Got a handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella (Let's go!)
I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this bitch with the Terror
One time for my homie, Sean Paul
Got a handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella
Coming home soon, we miss you nigga
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
Make it rain on them hoes (We The Best)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (We see no bond)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Listennn!)
Oww! Blat, blat, blat, blat! Ayy, Joey, let me get 'em
It's Young Money, and we on like the television
The Weather Channel, but I do not broadcast
I throw up more cash, and change the forecast
Your boyfriend is lame, I make it rain on you
He never make it rain, like Southern California
Where's your umbrella? Now, get your raincoat
Baby, I make it flood, now, you gon' need a boat

Fresh to death on 'em (Believe that)
We throwin' money on 'em (Throwin' money on 'em)
Stay fly, 25s when we ride on 'em
(That's how we ride on 'em)
Alligator suede, custom with the shades (Stunna shades)
Make it snow in the club, bitches know we paid (Rrrrrah)
Stay shine, rockin' Gucci in the Bentley (Super-fly)
White Rolls for my broad on them 23s (Stay fly)
Goin' to the club, nigga, in a new fleet (Yeah)
All red doors up, doin' it like a real G

Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror (Remix!)
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella (Diamonds, let's go!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Six City)
I'm in this bitch with the Terror (Magic City)
Got a handful of stacks (Rolex)
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh! Remix!)
Make it rain on them hoes (Remix!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Sue's Rendezvous)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Get your money right)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (Listennn!)
Oww!
Come and see me and Crack in the club flossin'
Forty-cal in my jacket, twenty stacks in my jeans
Know real boss niggas do real boss things
We 'bout that shit, you just talkin'
Young Sam Rothstein, out with my goons
In the 430, down the strip, I zoom
In the drop in January but it feel like June
Big Glock I carry make a real big boom (What!)
Make moves like a young tycoon (Ayy!)
I come through like a young typhoon (Ohh)
Category 3, don’t be categorying me (Geah, geah, geah)
With these niggas like they'll get a better salary than me (Oh)
I'm El Capitan, King, numero uno (It's the King, nigga!)
I flood pussy clubs, ask any stripper you know (Ayy!)

Ace Mizzy get all the hoes (Yeah)
Gonna teach them shit they want to know (Yeah)
Like, fuck that pussy-ass 9-to-4
Girl, make that bucket a pot of gold (Yeah)
It ain't no money like custom money (No)
It ain't no bitch like a hustle bunny (No)
Ain't no bitch gettin' none of my money
That why the money got a clip to protect it for me
She gotta ride for the A (Ayy), pop for the A (Ayy)
Live for the minute or be out for the day (Day)
Pop the metal but lookin' hot in stilettos
Got the rock with the bezel on the trigger finger
Boss bitch of the ghetto, my Spanish Trina
Talk shit to a nigga with the blammer beamed up (Know why?)
When I see her gotta handle my bid-nah
I gotta give her one of these in the back of the team truck

Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror (remix)
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella (We The Best, remix)
I make it rain, I make it rain
I'm in this bitch with the Terror (Uh-Oh!)
Got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella (I make it rain)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
Make it rain on them hoes (remix, remix!)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (We the best)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes (I said, we the best)
I make it rain, I make it rain (Oh!)
I make it rain on them hoes
Oww!

305 M-I-yayo! Ayy Khal', call Joe up
Let him know I'm at the Rolex, I just ran outta money
Make it rain, make it rain
I need to borrow 50 thousand, cash
Make it rain, make it rain

Make it rain, make it rain
Triple Cs, oh, yeah, and it's the remix

I be reppin' my city, blowin' hundreds and fifties (Yeah!)
If the head right, Ricky there e'ery night (Ayy)
Joey, I was listenin', pullin' up, spinnin' rims
Time to spend some dividends, my money they swimmin' in
Ross, I'm a boss (I'm a boss), I'm the mayor (I'm the mayor)
We make it rain (Make it rain), on these haters (On these haters)
Get your umbrella, fella, cause we blowin' hella cheddar
I'm the nigga that you scared of cause no one can do it better

Owwww! Joe Crack, early '80s, crack baby mama paid me
Maybach, fly Mercedes, birth that, drop it baby
Them purrty ladies (Yah), they drive me crazy (Yah)
Them skies is hazy (Yah), I'll pop like 80
Someone tell Mr. Bentley to bring his umbrella
Katrina, not! It's just the one fella (Crack!)
Who got dumb cheddar, and need a brain surgeon
Got me a designated thrower cause my hand's hurtin' (Ouch!)
I make it rain (Rain!), it's Coca bitch! (Bitch!)
It's not a game (Game!), them vatos locos-rich
Ain't nothin' wrong with wantin' a little happy endin'
And we don't need a hotel, we parkin' lot pimpin', bitch!

Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror (Remix!)
Got a handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella
Joey Crack, I salute!
I make it rain, I make it rain, I'm in this bitch with the Terror
Let's go!
