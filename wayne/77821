Hey, this drank got me feelin' like I'm on another planet
I'm a faint, man it feels like I'm on another planet
Whatcha think girl, I want it, I know you gon' let me have it
I'm on another planet, I'm on another planet
And I won't come down, it feels so good
I don't wanna come down, it feels so good
I walk around like I'm in space, cause it feels so good
I'm on another planet, I'm on another planet

I'm on another planet, ask me how I got there
I'm dressed as a captain cause my money so rare
I'm drinkin' on that shit, it lighty cost some bucks
Most people don't drink it cause it cost too much
And when I'm at the bar, I be lookin' like a star
I don't pull out cash, I be swipin' credit cards
Like Visa or Master, Express or black ones
They assume I'm famous like an artist or actor
Money's not a factor, I grow it out my ass
If money came from tree's, I would grow it in my plants
Grow it my garden like Remy Martin
Had me feelin' like I'm on Saturn and even Mars and

Goodbye world, it's Weezy aka Mr. He Stole My Girl

I got that bird flu from that grey goose
And I don't need no juice, just a little ice
And we can run around Saturn's ring twice
I like my wine white, yeah patron straight
I'll take you to Mars, and show you I got my own space
Stir, stir don't shake
Then don't break, I take you out this world
He just take you out the states
Syrup by the crate, man I'm on my eighth
It make me move slow so I'mma be a little late, Mula


I'm next to the moon, close to the sun
So call me a star, I'm as bright as they come
High in the sky, connected to big dippers
When they come to licker, I am the big sipper
Tell me have you ever seen an astronaut stripper
I don't do it on Earth, but here I'll tip her
Take her to my ship, and fuck to a sex tone
Right after I hit it, I'm dippin' to Neptune
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, take off
I can prove mercury ain't far as they say dog
Started on one fifth, now I'm on number four
And off of those four, I've been around the solar
