Lights, all of the lights

Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this "give-or-take" world, I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time, I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'ma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh!
No lights but them infrared lights
Long knife, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
You might also like
Ready, set, go, go, go, go, go
Go 'til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
"Westside bitch," quote, unquote
Whoa there, boy, don't go there, ho
If you cross that line, I might overload
I swear these lights-lights-lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named "Big" got bodied, huh?
But every rapper named "Sean" got money? Ooh
Well, I guess my chances are fifty-fifty
But my vision is 20/20, so I be counting a hundred hundreds
Like, oh, my Allah, Lordy Lordy Lordy
I took your chick, now you want beef, and I'm just chuckling like I'm Porky
'Cause you spent all day with her spooning
I spent all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and they want these bullets to book it for me, man
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin' broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gon' book report me, what?
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard (Hard), 'cause, bitch, I'm an emergency

Turn up the lights in here, baby (B-I-G)
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this (I do it)
Turn up the lights in here, baby (Boi, boi, boi)
You know what I need (Yeah)
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights (You know a nigga so good)
Whoa, whoa (So good, Westside)
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh (I'm so hood, I do it)
Whoa, whoa

Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding, Weezy with me
I just stepped out of the strip club, made five-thousand look like fifty
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush, but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made two million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I ain't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some "me time," it's our time, so fuck y'all
I'm really about to go Spring Break now
And start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas was going pop in this muthafucka?
Uh, Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV, it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
(Lights on) And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy, nigga, I'm not one, so call it a night, call it a night
(Lights on) And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that all in the Sprite, all in the Sprite
Gettin' mine, baby (Yeah)
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah (Shout out my nigga Cudi too, that's my motherfuckin' nigga for real, man)
Gettin' right, babe (Shout out Cole)
You should go and get ya own (Think we got a buzz now, nigga, fuck y'all niggas, man)
We're going all the way this time (I'm here)

We going all the way this time
Lights, lights
We going all the way this time (All of the Lights, all of the lights)
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time (All of the lights!)

All of the lights
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

All of the lights!23Embed
