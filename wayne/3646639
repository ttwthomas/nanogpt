23 ContributorsHercules Lyrics
*lighter flick*
Aye

I'm a lover, not a fighter, I can't find my lighter
My house is five stories, I don't tell 'em, I don't write 'em
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright, I'mma need a sun visor
187 make your bitch run my errands
At the bar with the Dracula, ordering Bloody Marys
Got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see Hell out my window, Lord, this view is amazing
If I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands, it got all under my nails
People under the stairs, better not fuck with my feet
I be so fucking faded, who washed the colors with bleach?
Niggas biting my style, hope it gets stuck in their teeth
I been had the green light, now please don't jump in the street
C'est la vie, oui oui oui, watch me french kiss the sky
Then ask, "What is that smell?" That's the shit on my mind
I don't like you, or niggas like you
And Nino Brown's still my motherfucking idol
Keep a brown rifle for niggas like you
Kill you in a drive-thru, then go viral
Ooh, I don't like you and niggas like you
And Nino Brown's still my idol
The Glock 17 is still a minor I'll kill you over something minor
I get at you, night Twighlight whine like a wine-o, high like a high-note
Go at your head like a rhino, leave your shit bloody red like albino
I'm a nigga with a title, care less bout' a nigga title
I'm entitled and get homicidal
Wild as El Chapo, wild as Al Qaeda
Stuntin' on my rivals upon arrival
Numbers aren't liars, I am number one
I am on one
I am on ten stuntin' on twelve
I keep it a hunnid
Oh Lord!

Nigga please, nigga please
You heard em' scream help me please
Help me please, help me please
Get pleased whenever I please
Hercules, hercules

I'm twisting up the kush, Sticky Fingaz like Onyx
Throwing up gang signs, you can see em' all in my vomit
I'm sleeping with the enemy, in bulletproof pajamas
I'm cool like that, but the climate is climbing
I got issues bigger than you, I got bitches taller than me
All that ratchet and bougie, I guess I like R&B
I'm unapologetic, I'm sorry for not being sorry
These niggas so old news, I’m talking prehistoric
I need benadryl for my trigger finger
Bad bitches for my homeboys
The grass is greener on the other side
I'm focused on my own yard
Focused on getting more dough
Twisting up like torsos
Rich as fuck, but moreso a poor soul
Oh well, if snow fell like hoes fell, then I'd be a snowman
My bitch is a soldier, fuck me GI Joe-Ann
They thought I ain't had no chance
I took the dice and rolled them
I left that crap table with a chip on my shoulder
Ahhhh!
Hercules, Hercules

You heard em' scream help me please
Help me please, help me please

They worship me certainly
Purple lean, purple weed
Percocet, pericyazine
Search a scene, search a dean
Search a bling, ching ching
Search the queen
Search her purse, search her clean
Search his turf, search his team
Search the sleeve, check for wings
First, I curse, then I squeeze
They say they lit? where the steam?
Let em' live, let em' breathe
Let em' live, let em' breathe?
Nigga please, nigga please
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Strong arm your own team
Murder scene, murder scene
Murder team, murder team
We murder teams, murder teams
Lil Tunechi picked out the rock like
Hercules, Hercules

Oh Lord, Oh Lord
Whole squad go hard
No fake, no fraud
We don't break nor pause
Oh Lord, Oh Lord
Whole squad on Mars
And you don't make enough noise
No cape, no sawdust
Still go Hercules

Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Mercy me, mercy me
Rest In Peace Mercy D
My grandmother nurtured me
And that's who you bout' to meet

All ya'll versus me
All ya'll verses sweet
Nothing but desserts to me, and Hercules got to eat
All ya'll take a seat
My Hercules got to speak
Cause all y'all 'bout to bring
The Hercules out of me
