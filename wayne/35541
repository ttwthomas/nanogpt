4 ContributorsPlay That Shit (We Don’t Play That) Lyrics
They call me the youngest headbuster walkin'
Thugged out in all black, calicole sparklin'
A guerilla 'til I die bless me when I'm dead
But for the bread I bring ya anybody head
That's how I play it I don't hold back
I tote gats be on the spot were ya sold crack
Nigga feel played then ya fuckin get blown back
I burn 'em twice with a black rusty old mac
Now, blocka, nigga, get off me

Get some off that cocky weed and roll that bitch up
Won't play with me like I'ma choke that bitch up
Keep it on the turf I might be killin' to get mine
New prints on the back I make a million in big time
I'll always be a thug until I'm crippled and crazy
I'ma always stay close with Suga Slim, Wayne, and Baby
Runnin' with a team off cut-throats and backshots
All day bullshittin' negligence and homicides

Cash Money niggas they don't play that shit
Thugged Out niggas we don't play that shit
Cash Money niggas they don't play that shit
Thugged Out niggas we don't play that shit
Cash Money niggas they don't play that shit
Thugged Out niggas we don't play that shit
Cash Money niggas they don't play that shit
Thugged Out niggas we don't play that shit

Thugged Out, Cash Money, huh

Yo we in the projects with my little honey ha
Yo what up Kiko it gets real check it
We got's these chicks to slauve that right out of Kansas
And them college bitches, we used to fuck 'em on campus
You my woadie, huh-huh, I'm your woadie, huh-huh
Fuck with us we leave you nigga fuckin' holy, huh
Semi-Latin cruise down to Baton Rouge
Then I got a Hummer that's sittin' on 32's
But for the hood we got the east coast locked
Magnolia and Iraq now that's my spots
Come anywhere near there and still be shot
Prat niggas, shot niggas, shot niggas, shot niggas, shot shot

I'm a thug B how you gonna stop hungry
We eatin' pop bubbley in beef we pop dummies
Run up in hood honey's it's all good sunny
Throw your sets up nigga

Ride or die young nigga
Get high young nigga
Stay fly young nigga
Do what you gotta survive young nigga

Live we fly down in New Orleans, get it purpulatin'
You smell me, keep that fire green circulating
Thugged Out with Cash Money
Thugs we stash your arms, weeds get blazed from your face till feet
With us all we stay deep got beef we're surroundin'
My niggas cock back MAC's from here to some 'the houses
Get rocked or get it on if you bout it
Cause boy you're in the zone
You take routes quick like Roy Jones
