14 ContributorsHot Shit Lyrics
Money over bitches thats the motto I follow
Take that to the grave I'll swallow 8 hollows
For the day I letta bitch stop me from gettin paid
No way I get head get laid get gone on em
Dont be mad I left 100 at the door for you
Baby dont spend it all at once its just a thought for you
Ain't that a dog for ya, some chicks like flees, you gotta use ya paws to get em off of ya
And in the streets you can't get caught trippin, caught slippin, gotta hustle gotta get in were you fit in
Hope you know how to make a dollar quicker then you spend it
Cuz there's bills comin in every second, every minute
And its coke on the dishes is you flippin or you sniffin
Put the coke in the water shit its kinda like fishin
No rod just a spoon I throw it and start mixing
Like that and like this and like that and a
Like this and like that you got crack voila
And since the towers fell niggas been mad as hell
Its been a drought out ain't enough crack to sell
But the world keep spinnin like a carousel
Gotta get the cash, get the cream and the caramel
On top gotta be on top strawberries whip cream on top
Get popped fuckin wit my m.o.n.e.y
Guys plot thats why I got the nina
Chop chop man that choppa lean ya
The blocks hot like its got a fever
Cops cops nuthin but cops I see ya peekaboo
They every where im never scared I hustle anyway
Everyday customers, send em here
And you know I give em that shit thats gon get em back coke crack sugar snaps
Or should I say sugar snacks
Coke in da sugar jar, cookie jar crib, car, a sugar shack
And the bitches sleep naked in the sugar shack
Mind on my money no lookin back
You might also like
I pop up in the middle of the hot block
Make the drop top play hopscotch on them hoes
Lil wayne, right from Kims corner store
Choppa wake a niggas ass up like tha mornin show
Put me in the game and I see em callin audibles
Hearts beatin fast betta work on ya cardio
How you want video, audio, part of yo body get mailed to ya gal, eww
Pussy ass nigga die slow dont yell
I put it on the streets and I bet its gone sell
Whats under that floor well it sure isnt nails
Just how I make money cracker I'mma make bail
Im a Libra and my sign is a scale
If it dont measure up then a nigga gettin killed
The smaller the car the bigger them wheels
And a nigga so hot that I give a bitch chills
And if she like coke then I give the bitch hills
No stilettos or pumps 21 bumps
21 Jump street if anyone jumps and once you hit the ground thats when everyone stomps
Perrier Jouet everyones drunk so its 21 Jump Street if anyone jumps
The milli goes pow and the semi goes pap
A itty bitty bullet make a skinny nigga fat
Hard body baby knockin any nigga back
And its money ova bitches not a penny ho scat
An it'll be like that 'til that line go flat
But in da mean time I'm in that bent no hat, thats no top if you didn't know that
On them chrome Sean Johns with them guts so black
In fact yall can leave that be bitch im ballin like I got scouts checkin for me yeah
Im on third base comin' home with the paper
I got 100 pounds comin' home from Jamaica
I can't think and my sprite so pink
And I might be floatin but I will not sink Weezy1Embed
