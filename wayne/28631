Dramatic, nigga!
Hustlin’, hustlin’, hustl’— Hustlin’, hustlin’, hustl’—
Haha! Shout-out my nigga, Rick Ross!
Shout to Slip-N-Slide!
Khaled! (My nigga, DJ Khaled! Dramatic)

Every day, I'm hustlin’— (Yeah)
Every day, I'm hustlin'— ("Dedication 2")
Every day, I'm hustlin’— (That's right)
Every day, I'm hustlin'— (Drama)
Every day, I'm hustlin’— (I see you)
Every day, I'm hustlin'— (I'm so dedicated right now!)
Every day, I'm— Every day, I'm— (Fee, baby!)
Every day, I'm hustlin'— (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
E—E—E—Every day, I'm hustlin’—
Every day, I'm hust'— (Hot Spitta!)
E—E—E—Every day, I'm hustlin’— (Twenty-four-seven!)
Every day, I'm— Every day, I'm— (Mack Maine)
Every day, I'm hustlin’— (Po, baby!)
Every day, I'm hustlin' (E-I, E-I, oh!)
Hustlin'— Hustlin'— ("D2!" )
Hustlin'— H-Hustlin'— (Gangsta Gri-zillz! Yeah!)

Now, what they do? You know it's Weezy F., the fucking boss
Inside the Phantom, bitch, so big, I probably get lost (Ill!)
Hop out that exhaust in my "Funky Cold Medina"
I make that ho tiptoe like a ballerina
I'm the Miami fever, in that Miami Heat
Hop in that Miami water—I'm like a Florida Marlin
But I come from New Orleans—nigga, we still strong
And my money real long—real, real, real long
And this my thirteenth year—bitch, I'm still goin'
So, my money real long—real, real, real long
Nigga, that steel on—red beam, safety off
Murder scene—tape it off; redrum, tomato sauce
Niggas say they paperboys; bitch, I be with caper boys
I say, "We be burnin' bodies, we don't be burnin' cars"
And I got a bitch with me— (Every day, I'm hustlin'—)
Call her "Ms. Without-Drawers" (Every day, I'm hustlin'—)
And I'm at the bank— (Every day, I'm hustlin'—)
You could call me "Mr. Withdrawals" (Every day, I'm hustlin'—)

Every day, I'm hustlin'— (Yeah)
Every day, I'm hustlin'— (Yeah)
Every day, I'm hustlin'— (Yeah)
Every day, I'm— Every day, I'm— (Gangsta! Yeah)
Every day, I'm hustlin'— (Yeah)
Hu—Hustlin'— Hustlin'—
Whip it real hard (Every day, I'm hustlin—)
Whip it— Whip it real hard (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

Want it, I'ma bring it—let Diana Ross sing it
I'ma pull it, I'ma bang it—that's that Nina Ross singin'
I be way in Opa-Locka with that Rick Ross bangin'
If you try me, I reverse you—now, you Kris Kross-swingin', yeah
Whip soft, top seats soft—let her feet prop
Heat cocked; something on my neck—look like a peacock
You need not talk that street hop to me, akh'
'Cause we pop, like thousand-dollar bottles of that Cris' Rock
Bitch, stop trippin': I been hot—when not?
I been threw away what they just got
And niggas talk shit, but when I see 'em, they lips lock, bitch bop
Know I got that oo-wop, grip-lock, get shot
Bitch, I bet I'm hustlin' when your nigga not (Every day, I'm hustlin'— E—Every day, I'm hustl'—)
Bigger appetite, bigger pot—"Eat!" (Every day, I'm hustlin'— E—Every day, I'm hustlin'—)
Every day, I'm hustlin'— (Yeah)
Every day, I'm hustlin'— (Weezy)
Whip it real hard (Every day, I'm hustlin'—)
Whip it— Whip it real hard (Every day, I'm— Every day, I'm—)

Call it what you want, but, baby, just don't call the cops
Let 'em chase that drop—I'ma chase that guap', yeah
Racetrack jacket with the racetrack Locs, yeah
All-black Maserati—taste that smoke (Gangsta!)
I'ma crack that egg open, beat that yolk
Let it soak, let it soak; watch it come back bulk—yeah!
Then, I hit the streets up and talk that talk
Let it float, let it float, never come back broke, naw!
Run that shit, I'm Cash Money's bread and butter—no sugar
Bring me all the beef: I'm the motherfucking pressure cooker
Yeah, yeah! I could change the weather for you
Lose your ass—the neighbors tell 'em that they never saw you
Close your mouth—it'd be better for you
All that snitchin', like the cops got a medal for you, ha!
I'm a hustler: got work, hoes, and metal for you (Every day, I'm hustlin'— E—Every day, I'm hustl'—)
When you think you're ready, I be ready for you, bitch! (Every day, I'm hustlin'— E—Every day, I'm hustlin'—)

Every day, I'm hustlin'— (Shout-out to the 3-0-5!)
Every day, I'm hustlin'— (Yeah, "Dedication 2")
Whip it real hard (Every day, I'm hustlin'—)
Whip it— Whip it real hard (Every day, I'm— Every day, I'm—)
Huh? (Philly to Miami)
I thought I told them niggas
Haha! (They got the official!)
Heh (Shoutout to MixUnit!)
