11 ContributorsHeaven Lyrics
Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
No it ain't my fault, we gotta eat nigga
Wonder where I'm going when I leave nigga
Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
No it ain't my fault, we gotta eat nigga
Wonder where I'm going when I leave nigga

I'm still riding with my pistol nigga
I hope the lord can forgive a nigga
I ain't make the rules up, I'm just a nigga
Hate to do it but I fuck around and shoot a nigga
I gotta hustle, went and gone with it
I'm tired of struggling, I'm gon' get it
No matter what it take, I'm coming home with it
Long as I feed the fam, I don't see nothing wrong with it
They got some pussy niggas hating on me
I'm skating on 'em, 28s homie
Think it's a game, I ain't find nobody playing on me
I ain't gotta touch a mic I drop some bands on 'em

Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
No it ain't my fault, we gotta eat nigga
Wonder where I'm going when I leave nigga
Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
No it ain't my fault, we gotta eat nigga
Wonder where I'm going when I leave nigga

With that 9, I'mma roll with 'em
Mama just pray for me, I don't back down from no nigga, they got a place for me
With that 9, I'mma roll with 'em
Mama just pray for me, I don't back down from no nigga, they got a place for me

I know everyday my mama praying for me
Every time I leave the crib, my children say they love me
I had to get it on my own, nobody give me nothing
I worked too motherfucking hard to let them take it from me
I ain't going down without a fight nigga
And I'm ready if it's going down tonight nigga
I know how I'm living ain't right nigga
But it's a must, I handle business on sight nigga
I be loaded like a motherfucker
But I'm focused like a motherfucker
I'm eating good but I don't know when it's my last supper
All the shit I done, wonder if I'll get to see my brother

Is there a heaven for a street nigga?

No it ain't my fault, we gotta eat nigga
Wonder where I'm going when I leave nigga

Mama just pray for me, I don't back down from no nigga, they got a place for me
With that 9, I'mma roll with 'em
Mama just pray for me, I don't back down from no nigga, they got a place for me

Tell them niggas holla at your boy dog
My niggas treat the car lot like the toy store
I'm sammy saucin on some foreign hoes
Got them fighting like the Maury show
I call wifey Rosario
Cause she look like that bitch Rosario
And we done like we hit the lottery
Still trapping out the private property
These lil niggas just some comedy
Ain't got no kind of green, no commodery
We gotta eat, I promise I don't miss a meal
We getting fat, there goes our modeling careers
Got the muscle, stepping on these weak niggas
Too much coke, just tell the kids it's bleach nigga
24/7, ready for the beef nigga
I swear this life feel like heaven to a street nigga, Tunechi

Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
No it ain't my fault, we gotta eat nigga
Wonder where I'm going when I leave nigga
Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
Is there a heaven for a street nigga?
No it ain't my fault, we gotta eat nigga
Wonder where I'm going when I leave nigga
With that 9, I'mma roll with 'em
Mama just pray for me, I don't back down from no nigga, they got a place for me
With that 9, I'mma roll with 'em
Mama just pray for me, I don't back down from no nigga, they got a place for me2Embed
