Ring, ring, ring, my plug gon' pick up for sure, 365, 24
Lean, lean, lean, I run through a pint like a four, I run through a pound like a O
Ting, ting, ting, bad lil' bitch is mine, I'ma ice her whole life out
Bling, bad lil' bitch is mine, I'ma ice her whole life
Ding, ding, ding, my shooters shoot shit up for sure, you can get your shit hit up for sure
Lean, lean, lean, I done ran through the pint like a four, I done ran through the pound like a O
Bling, bling, bling, bad lil' bitch is mine, I'ma ice her whole life out
Bling, bad lil' bitch is mine, I'ma ice her whole life out
