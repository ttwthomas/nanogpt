10 ContributorsHardbody Lyrics
Yea
Uh Huh
The Fuck Was I Thinkin?
Drought 3 Bitch!
Yeah Let Me Light My See Through Blunt
Whatchu Kno Bout It?
Get It!
Weezy's The Name
Moneys The Game
Already!

Hard Body Muddafucka Got The Heart Of A Killer
Young God In Da Buildin Bout To Start A Religion
Bout To Call Bin Laden Up And Order Some Missles
Brang Em Straight To Ya Block And Go To War Wit You Bitches
If U Hit The Head Then The Rest Fall In Position
Shoot A Nigga On His Porch And Make Him Fall In His Kitchen
Copped A Big Boy Porsche Wit All The Specifics
And I Keep That Torch Baby Call Me Olympics
Red White Blue Pills Flippin Skills Like Gyminsts
And Neva Give A Bitch Money Blood Or Kidneys
When The Gun Goes Pow I Be At The Finish
Wit My Medal Round My Neck Autograph On My Tennis
The Land Of Da Murder Dope Crack And Syringes
Pull Up On Ya In Da Coupe How Fat Is Ya Engine
Neva Talk To Those That Sat On Dem Benches Boy
I Was In Da Game On 4th And Inches
These Niggas Want The Business
Imma Give These Boys Da Business
See U Fuckin Wit Da Boy That Told Yall Ta Fuck Christmas
Got All These Hoes Trippin
Got All These Hoes Strippin
No We Ain't PSC But Them Bitches Know We Tippin
I Juss Bought A Pint And Ain't None Of Yall Sippin
Make My Friends Buy They Own Fuck Im Tired Of Being Friendly
Ain't Gotta Lie Juss To Try To Be Wit Me
Bitches Up In Heaven Waitin At The God To Be Wit Me
Im Crazy For Being Wayne Or Is Wayne Juss Crazy
I Been Around Im Still Around Like Them Geico Cavemen
Hairpin Trigga No I Won't Shave It
I Spot Hip Hop In The Ocean Im Gonna Save It
The South Is So Dirty Bitch U Can Bathe It
Hollygrove Dawg And I Feel Like Matin
Babygirl Yo Pussy Lookin So Vacant
And Its Fuck You And Fuck Georgia Bush Not Makin
Fuck Waste Deep Im In Ova My Head
But Its Cool Imma Make It Im Good Like Meagan
Your Girl Want Me To Come Ronald Like Reagan
Your Boyfriend Is Softer Than A Carton Of Eggs And
I Dont Fear Nothing But God And Weddings
At The Top Of My Paper Like Im Starting A Heading
My Homie Santana Yea Das My Ace
But You May Know Us As I Can't Feel My Face

And I'll Tell You Juss How The Top Feels When Im On
In The Game Im No Cheetah Imma Tiger Imma Cougar Imma Panther Imma Bengle

In A Pair Of Gucci Flops Feelin Free-er Than Willie
When Dem Niggas Left I Got A Little Bit Chilly
But I Juss Let It Burn Like The End Of The Philly
