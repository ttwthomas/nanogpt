Like 2 Chainz, nigga

I'm different, I'm different
I'm different, I'm different
Shit different, lit different
Drip different, sip different
Smoke different, hoes different
My bros different, I'm no different
My whip different, I'm stick shiftin'
I tip different, she quit strippin'
My bitch different, I just slip in
It hit different, I switch position
This dick different, it hit different
Got her walkin' different, she sit different
My money different, my chips different
Big difference, like Miss Winfrey's
I know it cost to be the boss, I paid the difference
Like 2 Chainz, nigga, I'm different

I've been graveyard shiftin', makin' baseball figures
Goin' Karen in the park 'cause I hate y'all niggas
When the drought go down and the weight go fizzup
I'ma tote A-Rod, no J-Lo, nigga
Got a payroll, nigga, count like Kango, nigga
Shoot like Faygo, nigga, soft as Play-Doh, nigga
I can go anywhere that you can't go
I lay your ass down 'bout Halo
Southside, G-Road and Clayco
Can't forget about Heaven and Harmony
Ain't nobody out there harmin' me
Rock the old Atlanta like the motherfuckin' omni, calmly
I got some weapons like armory, uh
So Help Me God, solemnly, yeah
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, smellin' like lottery
Lookin' like lottery, came from the Clay like pottery
I got the rage inside of me, I got the gauge on side of me
Just checked my page, I'm proud of me
Folk out the can like potted meat
Stars in my roof, astrology
Teachin' valet the technology
Hustlin', it run through my artery
Probably trappin' and boost the economy, yeah
You might also like
Yeah, the feds all over me, nigga, and I don't even trap no more
Your bae all over me, nigga, but, dawg, you can have that hoe
My side bitch fuckin' my main bitch, they don't even clash no more
My side bitch fuckin' my main bitch, uh

I've been talkin' to myself
I told myself, "I gotta get my shit together" (Together)
Man this shit is just like Tetris
Get the bricks together, make 'em fit together (Together)
Got a line on everything
Man, I can give whatever and get this shit whenever (Whenever)
Uh, I can ship this shit wherever
Ten bathrooms, I can shit whenever (Whenever)
Just 'cause you see me with her
That don't mean me and the bitch together (Oh, no)
I've been cheatin' on my bae
And now me and bae'll fuck a bitch together (Oh, oh)
With two horns stickin' out the GOAT head
You know he's just the devil (Oh, oh)
And this shit right here, this shit right here

This shit different, lit different
Drip different, sip different
The pack different, the Act' different
My bros different, I'm no different
Got no ceilings, no ceilings
No ceilings, it's missin', it's missin'
In your feelings, you're trippin'
Come up missin', good riddance2Embed
