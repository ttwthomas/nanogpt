6 ContributorsLove To a Diplomat Lyrics
I had to tell her I don't care
Can't lie, young, she got 
I don't care, I told her "suck my dick"
And I had to ask her this...

Ever made love to a Diplomat?

I be with some Asian girls and we lost in Japan
I tell 'em konichiwa, they say "of course you the man"
I told 'em "I hear you, but that ain't important to Cam"
I got my bitch choo-choo-choo poppin' right off of the Grand
She be selling hair, I sell drugs, we both down for the hustle
And we speak the same language, yeah, ounces and bundles, kilos too
Either way, keys of yay', TV shows with Lisa Ray
Then back to the block, do I need to say, boy homo that E and J
Aye, you get no chicks, that's no mystery
The last girl you been in, Statue of Liberty
And I fouls with this, you can have my ass to kiss
But when I seen ya baby mama, had to ask her this...


I clean up well, loafers down to moccasins
Back up off me, baby girl, I need some oxygen
Yeah, I know, I know, I'm Mr. Get It Poppington
But every time I see you coming, I'm like not again
Chill girl, chill girl, I'm done, I ain't got more to give
You can't cross the line, cause I let you cross the bridge
It's blood banks, it's weed spots
You can make 100 an hour sucking three cocks
I don't care if your mother's sick, the rent's due
You got 3 dollars, good, bitch, spend soon
