78 ContributorsLose Lyrics
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

I'm gon' need therapy
'Cause you're not here with me
Light me up like amphetamines, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't do guarantees

I, I, I-I
Wish I could lie

You got me fallin' thinkin' of you (Thinkin' of you)
But that's the one thing I shouldn't do (I shouldn't do)
I, I know the truth (Know the truth)
I, I know that you're just one more thing to lose

Uh, she loves me, she loves me not, patience, I'm runnin' out
Walkin' all over me, made me her stompin' grounds
Baby, you fucked around, gave me the run-around
Makin' me wonder how crazy and dumb I sound
Takin' me up and down, baby, I'm comin' down
I'ma need some extermination, I'm buggin' out
Stay for another round, maybe she'll come around
She gon' have me turnin' in my grave when I'm underground
Sore loser, I saw you with him, I almost threw up
Don't shoot her, don't talk to her
There's plenty fish in the sea and I'm a shark, bitch, like Mark Cuban
You got me fallin' for you
With no wings on, no parachute
Bring a star back for you
They say love's a lost art
I draw that for you and I fall back for you
You might also like
You got me fallin' thinkin' of you (You got me fallin')
But that's the one thing I shouldn't do (The one thing that I shouldn't do)
I, I know the truth (Know the truth, I know the truth)
I, I know that you're just one more thing to lose

I be actin' out, I know, I know
When I stare at you, I lose control
And I'm hopin' you're not psychic (Psychic)
Hotter than the devil but you're righteous (Yeah)
I'm addicted to the whole of you (Whole of you)
Calling 'cause I needed more (More)
Stalling 'cause you know I fall
My whole demeanour and all, the fact of me losin' you (You)
Comparin' and stuck in a loop (Loop)
Grow old 'til there's nothin' to do (Do)
I'm alone in this space and my story is endin' with you

I, I, I-I
Wish I could lie

You got me fallin' thinkin' of you (You got me fallin', You got me fallin')
But that's the one thing I shouldn't do (I shouldn't do, The one thing that I shouldn't do)
I, I know the truth (Know the truth, I know the truth)
I, I know that you're just one more thing to lose
I'm gon' need therapy (Oh, no)
You naked next to me (Oh, oh, yeah)
Light me up like amphetamines, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
No, I don't do guarantees (Guarantees)

I, I, I-I
Wish I could lie40Embed
