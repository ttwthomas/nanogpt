2 ContributorsOperate On Me Lyrics
Prada jeans... 300 dollars
Gucci slippers... 500 dollars
Spending all your money to make these white folks rich... Priceless

They said opposites attract, so here I am
With my pistol in my pocket, hidden right under my jacket
They said opposites attract, so here she is
With a Masters and a Bachelor, she just became a doctor
Operate on me, I need that open heart surgery
Cause the way my heart is feelin', I can't make it through the night
Operate on me, I need that open heart surgery
Cause the way my heart is feelin', I can't make it through the night

Pocket full of money and some dark shades
Flow so current, he can start waves
Game like butter, he Parkays
Love me some head like chardays
Coppin' quarters like the arcade
Get high with my animals in our cage
And you can see us if you star gaze
Creole boy, baby I sautees
On your mark, ready, start race
That's just you makin' my heart race
And I may be the opposite, but I'mma let you operate
You might also like

And I know she want a D-boy
So I'mma pop up on her like 
I got that magic, like Bruce Leroy
And if this isn't it, then love has a decoy
Her body sicker than a retard
And I bet I got the medicine she need for it
And i bet I got the medicine to keep goin'
She shoots me with happiness, and I bleed joy
No Band-Aid for me boy
A loss of blood, yeah the girl got me weak boy
Yeah, I see you, and I see you
When I see you, girl, you're the one, can I be two?
And if your love is clear, then I see through
Then they yell "clear," and I pull through
You saved my life, baby I would too
And they say...
