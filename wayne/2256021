I like tuh, smoke all this weed by myself
Put my woes on they feet, my feet up like I fell
I got hoes on they feet, only toes on my heels
Bullshit walks, money talks, yours say TTYL
Lord, I like to fuck, sip, and get paid a grip
Like to eat pussy lips like some potato chips
Like to party with my homies, fuck you and your homies
I had you niggas pushin' up daisies and begonias
My flowers made in California, that’s for paranoia
I ash it on you, getting head like some castor oil
A casanova to the bread, to the cash, I’m loyal
The pastor close the casket on you, now I’m dancing on you
I like to make money, get turnt
I got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I got my work twerkin' like the lil' white girl
I used to make it all off the white girl, but now I just
I like to make money, get turnt
I got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I got my work twerkin' like the lil' white girl
I used to make it all off the white girl, but now I just...
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work
You might also like
I like to roof off in the booth
Had to mix the white with the Goose
Pineapple with a little bit of juice
Your girl over there, you know she gon' choose
We the winners, natural born sinners
Come off in this bitch like, "Yeah what's for dinner?"
Eat these chumps up, and spit 'em back out
I'm the hottest mothafucka in the north and the south now
I make money and get turnt
Spend it all at the bank
Put it all on dank
We don't play no games
I like to make money, get turnt
I got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I got my work twerkin' like the lil' white girl
I used to make it all off the white girl, but now I just
I like to make money, get turnt
I got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I got my work twerkin' like the lil' white girl
I used to make it all off the white girl, but now I just...
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I got the white girl twerkin', yeah
I got the white girl twerkin
I got the white girl twerkin
I got the white girl twerkin', yeah
I got the white girl twerkin
I got the white girl twerkin
I got the white girl twerkin
Ayy, I got the white girl twerkin
I got the white girl twerkin
I got the white girl twerkin
Yeah like the work
Show up at a party, vanish with the women
Stains on her blouse, I'm just damaging her linen
Living real comfy, there's advantages to winning
I’m just making rappers jealous now the damage is beginning
Yeah, I swear I'm Elvis to these hoes
Selfish when she blows thrust pelvis to her nose
Dapper Dan, make her clap for bands
And I’m taking down her, and her, and her ampersand
This shit is bonkers, high like the copters
Slam princesses, man he comes and he conquers
Then he’s moving onwards, groupies after concerts
Would prefer the smart ones cause the brain is better on nerds
Yeah, your game is lousy
Blow got me up but them bars got me drowsy
Rowdy, do not leave your girlfriend around me
I'll take her and free her from you, no more Saudi
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work12Embed
