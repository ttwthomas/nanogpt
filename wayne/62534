Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am
Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am

I am what a faucet is to some water
Water and a chain when a chain
I’m a target, target to a stalker
Stalking not an option
Options got plenty of those many female partners
Pardon my nonsense
Time erased don’t take much often
Often are parties, party get nauseous
You nauseous be cautious, cause cautious can get you farther
My father was uh never around so some hard times tarnished
But I’m sorry

Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am
Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am
See Tyga LiveGet tickets as low as $44You might also like
Mostly my writting is cake to the icing
Icing on a track, on a track I am lightning
Fast when I’m striking
Thunder when I’m fighting, fighting for this title
And the title reads idol
Idol from the biters, they bite it, plagiarize it
They playing when I’m grinding, grinding through a fire
To a fire I’m a lighter, to a picture I’m a striker
A Tyson when its violence, I’m solid
I am

Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am
Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
A legend I am

Welcome to a sound to a sound I am loud
I am loud to a crowd and a crowd goes for miles
I am what I am to a fan I am him to him his profession
