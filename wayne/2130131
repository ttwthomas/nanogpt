My nigga we hustle
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle
My nigga we hustle
That's muscle on muscle on muscle
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle
My nigga we hustle
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle
That's muscle on muscle on muscle on muscle on muscle on muscle
My nigga we hustle
That's hustle on hustle on hustle
Hustle on hustle on hustle on hustle on hustle
My nigga we hustle

Everybody knows Zeke nigga
7-30 that's me nigga
Dreamchaser like Meek nigga
Business man and street nigga
Pulled up and I skrrt off
Titties out when the skirt off
Pussy wet for that Birk off
We turned up and she turned on
We hustle
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle
I'm getting that work on a muscle
I'm hittin' the block, then we bubble
My dogs bite through that muscle
I'm Harlem wit' it when I come through
My Bronx niggas ready to rumble
I'm G'd up and stay humble
We don't get it twisted
This street life we really lived it
Fucked them birds and we f'd the chicken
Cookin' up chef in the kitchen
Frontline when I'm in the trenches
Shittin' on 'em 
Strapped up  as the business
Starin' the ground, we gotta get it

My nigga we hustle

The neighbours don't like me cause they know I'm pumpin'
Bitch I ain't cooked all the yayo for nothing
I'm sippin' that syrup like an eggo I’m muddy
I'm whippin' that sauce like some prego or something
Bitch I'm the boss watch me takeover something
My mexican pay me in pesos or something
They call me Jose like Canseco, I'm druggin'
We open up shop and we never close, we never close
I hustle on holidays, I hustle all night and day
I sleep in my clothes, I hustle all kinda ways
I'm steady findin' ways, it’s sweeter than gold
I hug the block, like 'It's gon be alright,  I grieve and console
Buku niggas on my front porch, you know that's like a 100 guns
Let the bitch bag up the coke, and suck the residue off each others thumbs
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle
That's duffle on duffle on duffle
We smuggle, we smuggle, we smuggle
We are the ones you gotta come to
My nigga we hustle
My nigga we hustle (yeah)
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle (we hustle)
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle (we hustle, we hustle, we hustle)
My nigga we hustle (we hustle, yeah)
That's muscle on muscle on muscle (that's muscle)
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle (we hustle, we hustle, we hustle)
My nigga we hustle (we hustle, yeah)
We hustle, we hustle, we hustle (we hustle)
That's muscle on muscle on muscle on muscle on muscle on muscle
My nigga we hustle (yeah)
That's hustle on hustle on hustle (that's hustle)
