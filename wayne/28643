24 ContributorsForever Lyrics
Let's do it!
Forever
And that I will
Yes
Gotta get 'em
Fee!

Straight-up gangsta, Hollygrove gangsta
Lay a nigga down in pink stuff
Them soft-ass dudes just think tough
We shooting—put them shanks up
We tryna live to summer and put them minks up
I'm synced up in the coupe, the eyes Chinked up
Pull up on a bitch at the light—that night, linked up
Whole lotta shit in the life of a young boss
Bet that VVS ice will bite your face off
Yeah, I ignite and take off—now, catch up
I'm the best doing it—c'mon, niggas, 'fess up
Nigga feel different, he could chess up, and guess what?
I bring it to his chest—to his right lung and left lung
Nigga get a checkup, nigga, put your check up
I swear, I'm on fire, need water like a hiccup
So I guess I might as well could say that
I'm the best today, and...
You might also like
Forever
Forever

Yeah, candy paint! T, I'm riding in a peppermint
Even my leather got leather trim
I'm on another element
I keep somethin' in the trunk like a elephant
Bet you remember it, like a elephant
I got this rap bottled up like medicine
Who's better than...? Fuck him!
I probably fucked her—ehh, what's new?
And if you hatin' on us, yeah, fuck you
And if them bitches wanna fuck us, we wan' fuck too
What a coincidence
And we cause accidents, not incidents
I am big shit, they're eensy-wens'
They're not even a letter in my sentences
Sitting in my coupe on 20-inch
So it's like I'm fencing, bitch, I will stunt...
Forever
So stop being defensive, bitch
I'm relentless, bitch, I'm in this shit...
Forever
Now end this shit2Embed
