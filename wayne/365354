12 ContributorsGet At These Niggaz Lyrics
Ay yo Weezy--you ready to get at these niggas, man?

You already got em

Who you? Weezy Baby
I do what the fuck I wanna come from the corner they call (what?)
Apple and Eagle where your mama didn't want you at all (yep!)
Packing them heaters in the heat of the moment
Strapping them kilos in that seat of that Honda--we on one
Back in the G a quarter-key was the normal
Jack a nigga if he hurtin' not believing in karma but
What if he armed and what if he ready to shoot?
We strap up shut the fuck up and dippity do what we gotta
Who we gotta,when we gotta
It's murder murder mur murder murder, don't think about it
One thing about it them niggas hoes they ain't about it
Complain about it and ain't around it, shame on 'em
I gain honor, fame, power, money, bitches
More problems and more guns, simple addition
Plus, I got choppers on the hog
Homie on bed rest head doctor on call
I got a masseuse who'd rather seduce me
Now everytime she hear my name she salute me
Bitch nigga do you cause I know Imma do me
Born from New Orleans you gon have to shoot me
You might also like
Streets my heart I love her to the core
But she just like a bitch, man she fucking with them all
So, I'm strapped up never coming in the raw
Magnum when I'm coming through the door, whats it for? (you know)
And I ain't talkin condom, nigga, I'm talkin 45 palm a nigga, launch a nigga back
Send him back home with his back blown to the point where you can see his back bone stickin out
I stick it out when it's drought time, too
Make it work like the first I'm about mines dude (ya know)
I get it crackin I'm about my moves
Don't step on these Gators I'm about my shoes (boy!)
And you don't want me to step out my shoes and step out my groove and let out my tools
The hammer kill, the hammer will make you stop, drop and roll like you slipped on a banana peel
Live by the code and honor honor the code
Stop snitchin, be a man nigga honor your role
I stick by the stove, when I'm on it it's on
You see that coke turn to oil it's on, nigga it's on
You see that hard base and the water is soft
Gimme that ice lemme show you it's on, nigga it's on
I'm sellin heavy things, down to anything
Bricks, half quarters, I got everything ya digg?
Aye

Come equipped with them sizzlers for the blizzard
Here's a sick sickle for you and your lil niggas
Elz, Imma get em--they bitches they just bitches
Just bought a new Glock 40 shots hair trigger
Shots through the driver side that mean the driver died
Car crash kill the passenger double homicide
We in all black like Amistad
They call my crew old school cause we walk around with 99s
Millimeters red dot find the spot
Head shot body drop
Two fingers I'm out
Gunslinger Hollygrove, Fireman kinda hot
Tie yo ass up and leave ya body in the loadin docks
New Orleans rollin rock Syrup in the soda pop
I can get rich all I need is a stove
And I'll stand over that bitch til them thangs get swole
And I'll work that corner in the heat or the cold
I'm good
Yeah
This right here is what you niggas didn't want
Yea, bitch nigga I'm in Harlem
Yea, pussy nigga I'm way in Harlem
Yea, they took my city so I'm in Harlem, fuckin' wit Elz nigga
Santana, red bandana nigga
Holla at ya mu fuckin boy
Elz, these niggas looking like they ate a dick
That's how these niggas looking in the mufucking face
Shut the fuck up nigga
Quarter to a key come see me nigga
Yeah, they talking bout New Orleans gone
Nigga I am New Orleans, nigga
That's right
Yeah, but like I said bitch nigga I'm in Harlem nigga!
Fuckin' with Elz niggaEmbed
