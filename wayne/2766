Love is the party, my heart is such a disco ball
She's in line waitin', my guest list too long
I told her I would love her, love her lasts forever
Forever's just a word, I put words together
Steppin' on the stars, she pause
And I know that one day this show will end - applause
The strobe lights are dancin', we've takin' all the chances
She question what we are, and I'll drink to the answer
Cause my heart is out of service, my eyes turn black
I don't see love anymore I'm blind to the fact
I got my world in my pocket, cause I ain' tryna drop it
The sky is at my neck, so I turn up my collar
My world spin around her cause it's a world without her

When you know, like I know
When the sunlight falls down
There she goes
Strobe lights dance with the stars
And I just can't live without her
And she knows what she knows
And the rain is coming down
My heart is cold, I know she knows
Strobe lights dance with the stars
And I always take my time
You might also like
And when the lights fade
The lights they turn grey
Bitch, you don't love me no more
I'm at the end, babe, goin' the wrong way
And I don't know where to go
I'm on a new way, tomorrow's too late
Bitch, you don't love me no more
You got me
Standin' on the verge

Love create wars, I got wounds and scars
The strobe lights are dancin'
Dancin' with the stars, but what happened to ours?
What happened because the rain is coming down
Now we trapped in the storm
And I stepped right out of her spotlight
And into the strobe lights
I don't need your light

I know I know I know
That you're no good
I know I know I know
That you make me
Come back for more
Come back for more
Every time I try, I can't get away
I know I know I know
That love is gone
I know I know I know
When the lights they fade away
You keep beggin' me, beggin' me:
Please don't go
And when the lights fade
The lights they turn grey
Bitch, you don't love me no more
I'm at the end, babe, goin' the wrong way
And I don't know where to go
I'm on a new way, tomorrow's too late
Bitch, you don't love me no more
You got me
Standin' on the verge2Embed
