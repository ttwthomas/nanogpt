Soulja Boy
Weezy

Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said, "What's up?"
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, oh
Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said, "What's up?"
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, oh

Count so much money every day is gettin' my arms swole
My swag is outer space, similar to a wormhole
Dunkin' on the game like Stephon Marbury
I got red Aston Martin, I call it my strawberry
All work, no play, this is my playground
Rappers on tour but, they ridin' a Grayhound!
But they don't stay round now, my Lambo got surround sound
I'm hotter than plasma, lava, magma!
Knick-knack, paddywhack, give the dog a bone
I'm like get back, gimme dat, give the king his throne
You like knick-knack, paddywhack, give the dog a bone
I'm like get back, gimme dat, give the king his throne
Honey, I am home
Walk into the dealership, add another whip to my collection
Of pink slips
I am it!
And don't forget, this, this is the remix!

Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said, "What's up?"
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, oh
Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said, "What's up?"
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, oh

Swagger on a zillion
I'm Louie V down, like a Louie V chameleon
House so big, like I live in a buildin'
No chandeliers, I got guns hangin' from the ceilin'
Brand new car, I divorced the top
See, homie, you a square, I'm a Porsche Box
Long hair, don't care, holla back, bitch
I'm in the bathroom, takin' me a rich nigga shit
Yeah, gangsta to the gristle, swagger on official
I'm the shit and you, you just a maggot on a tissue
Better tell 'em I'm hotter than a Arizona missile
White Benz, chrome wheels like a napkin on a nickel
Young Moolah, baby, Weezy baby, don't forget the Weezy baby
Black card boy, make ya throw away that Visa baby
You ain't on the planet I'm on, and I never leave my swagger at home

Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said, "What's up?"
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, oh
Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror, said, "What's up?"
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, oh2Embed
