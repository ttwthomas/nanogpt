1 ContributorNEVER BACK Lyrics
To the world yeah
A step down those streets
No i will never back never retreat
Did you see me looking back
Yeah i will never back,take a break
You broked me hard your pain in my heart
The world is going around i can't see the ground i can't see those streets
It's so fucking dark so...

Give me a chance break that monster in that cage
Fuck this world who wants to leave
Through the sky no limits
Not good at living this life i can't see this was coming
But the future is my past that's mean I'm stuck in it
So stand up fight like a man
Drop those letters make them feel this line like shot to their ears,don't stop it
Be good at it so don't stop i live to play
This world is my cack sucker,dive in those letters make them suck your pain
Motherfucker fell this line you are gaining nothing from this shit
So i start knocking i fell like dying so i fell nothing mother fucker
Fell this line my gold digger i have nothing for you to take
Bad luck so start follow

To the world yeah
A step down those streets
No i will never back never retreat
Did you see me looking back
Yeah i will never back,take a break
You broked me hard your pain in my heart
The world is going around i can't see the ground i can't see those streets
It's so fucking dark so...
I have nothing for you to takeYou might also likeEmbed
