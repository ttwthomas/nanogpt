23 ContributorsHave It Your Way Lyrics
Aight man, big money conversation poppin' off right here
Large numbers and plenty zeros (hmm-mm)
Hides yo' hoes and protect yo' egos (yeah)
What you see before you right now is a hustler like no other
One of grand proportions, can you dig it? Haha
Now what we gon' do here, we gon' show you petty hustlers out there
How to have it yo' way (okay); Get Dough Or Die (yeah) floss at all cost (yeah)
Cash out, mash out, brought to you by, Grand Hustle and Young Money
I hope you niggas bought money (HA-HAAAA) let's go...

You know what it is, pimpin' king in the building (okay)
All about the millions, no time to play with children (what)
Call me when you grown up, nigga, I'm an owner (ay)
Them Ferraris doin' doughnuts on the corner (BOW)
I went for mine, nickels, dimes, choppers, .9s, .45s (what)
Went to prison, did my time (yeah), got back out and still I shine (OH)
This year is mine, nigga, give it up, step aside
I'mma ride 'til I die, all bullshit aside (WESTSIDE)
Think I'm faking? Come and try - just prepare to be surprised (HA)
If you lookin' for some drama, it's my pleasure to oblige
We believe in the now, what I rep I be about (okay)
That's the reason why I'm hot, from a little to a lot
I ain't asked for permission, I just mashed for a minute (BOW)
First the business, then the cash, then the club, then the bitches (OH)
Stay your ass out the kitchen, it's too hot, shit, you not (yeeeah)
Know you niggas gettin' mad cause you see I'm gettin' guap (HEY)

Uh, two white girls in my bed
One still up, one asleep; I'm on the balcony
Smokin', on the phone with my girl
She like "I know somebody over there, cause nigga you never go on the balcony"
What's poppin', I'll make you bow down and welcome me
I played my cards right and your girlfriend dealt with me
Mama, I'm a motherfucker when I get the alc' in me
But I just popped a Perc and you know can't mix that medicine
With alcohol; don't get yourself involved
I see you pussies getting old - menopause
Too much pussy on the road - I'm homesick
AK-47 right under my armpit
We them niggas that they act like - get the facts right
Cat-eyed Benz, cat-eyed Beamer, cat fight
Cat-eyed bitch in a cat suit with tattoos
My swag mean, nigga - bad mood
Haha, yeah, yeah... YOUNG MULA BAAA-BAAAY

I'm so about my business, 'bout that money always
That's how we do it all day, all day, all night (yeah, yeah)
We can do it all day, okay? Alright, alright (ay, ay, oh)
I'm just keeping my way, we can parlay
I'm so about my business, 'bout that money always
That's how we do it all day, all day, all night (ay, ay, ay, oh)
We can do it all day, okay? Alright, alright (yeah, yeah, yeah, BOW)
