11 ContributorsDiamonds & Girls Lyrics
Yeah
C3, baby
Young Weezy and young Curren$y, you understand me?
This how we doing it

Di-diamonds and girls (Uh-oh)
Di-diamonds and girls (Uh-oh)
Di-diamonds and girls (Uh-oh)
Di-diamonds and— diamonds (Yeah)
Di-diamonds and girls (Yeah)
And girls (Yeah)
And girls
Di-diamonds and— (Get 'em!)

Ugh, like five, six chains on (Ooh)
Slick Rick, no patch, just frames on (Hey)
Marc Jacobs Aviators and a V-neck (Yeah)
Ten bitches, ten pistols on the P-jet
In a drop-top Madina with the top up (Err!)
I'm in that bitch getting neck like a shotput (Ha)
Hundred thousand for the grill, if I lie, I die (Bitch)
Flow sick, so sick, see the cyanide (Sick)
And here's my most funniest joke:
"I'm broke!" Hahahaha
Don't worry 'bout me, the money got me (Yeah)
And I keep the burner on me like an ID (Yeah)
The Lamborghini orange like vitamin C (Yeah)
And leave a bitch stuck like a kite in a tree
Weezy F.B., the money is the matter
I'm working like a bad bladder, M.O.B
You might also like
Di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and— diamonds
Di-diamonds and girls
And girls
And girls
Di-diamonds and— (Yeah)

Hailing from the bottom of the map
But standing at the top of the game
Kush got a nigga looking like I could really use a nap
But I'm still out wildin' with the gang
Got diamonds in my chain, more colors than the Northern Lights
Life is a traffic jam, but I'm on a motorbike
Zigzagging past these bastards, laughing at 'em
I got them suicidal like the doors on the Phantom, yeah
Hot Spitta, nigga—who you thought it was?
Bitches want to hold me in the morning like a coffee mug
I don't try to lock 'em down 'cause I am not an officer
I just knock them down in groups of ten
As if I'm in the lane aiming for bowling pins
Then, the style switch so quick
Have you thinking that the disc skipped, pimpin' serious
Make them bring it back like pass interference, yeah
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and— diamonds
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls
And girls, di-diamonds and—
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and— diamonds
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls
And girls, di-diamonds and—

Chyeah, hehe, speedboat, wife-beater
Ballin' like Derek Jeter for every reason
That Testarossa can get ghost like it never seen you
The same color as sesame-a, diarrhea
The pioneer, I am here, right here
The watch nasty like gonorrhea
Money long like Nia, I appear via satellite
Whomever don't like the premiere, he a hermaphrodite
Vegetables up in my ear (Ooh), get it clear (Ooh)
Pretty women want this nigga right here like Richard Gere (Yeah)
I switch the gear (Err!), and steer and disappear (Gone)
And if I ever jump off a pier, I would probably fly

Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and— diamonds
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls
And girls, di-diamonds and—
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, di-diamonds and— diamonds
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls
And girls, di-diamonds and—Embed
