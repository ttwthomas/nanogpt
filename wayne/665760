Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs
And since I'm paid, niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Yes sir

Check me out, look
26 inches, bitch I'm sittin' crooked
Old school Chevy, faster than a silver bullet
Strawberry paint, seats vanilla puddin'
2 bitches, gon' and eat each other's pussy
Top chopped sent the car to the barbershop
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot
I'm so unothodox
I got your bitch ridin' my dick wit no shocks
(Bounce bitch, bounce, bounce)
I'm the hottest shit jumpin' out the coffee pot
Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup and I can make a soda pop
Keep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop
Real niggas wit me ridin' till the motor stop
I got these hoes straight livin' out the soap op
I got it covered like a coke top
Okay?
Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs
And since I'm paid, niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm
Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs
And since I'm paid, bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back

See they gon' respect me
Believe that
Get 'em

Hollygrove, Jalapeña
Take a bite give ya ass a high fever
Them niggas jokin' I'm laughin' like a hyena
Real talk I had a Bird before I had a Beamer
Real talk I had the Beamer before I had the Benz
Swear to God I had the Benz before I had the Bentley
I ain't lyin' I had the Bentley before I got the Rolls Royce
Control it by voice I'm done with it
Chauffeur in the driver seat doesn't come with it
I gotta pay dude every day dude
Them niggas soft them niggas just beginner food
They ain't fuckin' with my interlude
Ha ha yeah, I get women in the mood
In the mood to get in the nude
And when we in the nude
Don't intrude she's falling apart
She wanna get screwed (C.M.B. nigga)
You can have a family feud
You jump in that water you will get brewed. Boy

Santana, ya dig (Ay!)
Let me talk to em. Let me get em
I make big money, I drive big cars
I smoke big blunts I don't need to hit y'alls
I'm higher then the stars, I'm higher then the sky
I'm sittin' on Mars, I'm higher then high
I'm flier then fly, chrome hard chain
From the wallet to the belt loop rock n roll fly
I dig the ladies the ladies dig I
So I dig they back out and make the chicks cry
(gotta) send em to they ma (gotta) send em to they pa
(gotta) send em to they guy (what)
There's something on they mind
There's money on my mind like Weezy Baby said
I ain't talking for this money
I'm speakin' to your head (Bang) ya dead
The two cock and pop yeah like boom shockalocka
Me I'm at the pool smooth colada, I'm sippin' on it
A long straw in my lap got the pistol on it
You see it I ain't sittin' on it (Nope!)
And my pockets full of cash money
Dipset bitch Cash Money fuck of the last supper
