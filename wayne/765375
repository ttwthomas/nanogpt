1 ContributorGet It Shawty Lyrics(Lil Wayne: talking)
Lloyd I got you
Yeah
(Lil Wayne:)
Ok, Im Weezy baby
And I am from the south where we call all our women baby
Hey baby, hey baby, all day i say hey, hey, hey
I ballin like Fade-A-Way, 3 letter credit A OK
Black car, black car, girl I got a black car
Can I buy some of your time and charge it to my black card
You can be my bittersweet, shake that sugar and salt
Chain full of asphalt, bullshit walks, cash talks
Car black, car big, car fast, Car-ter
Can I stick my pencil in your sharpner
Beat it up like its a drum, call me Travis Barker
Tat tat tat, boom boom, tat tat, boom boom, tat tat Brrrrrrrr Pshhh
(Lloyd:)
All I really want is for you to back it up gon and put your weight on it
Cuz its all right, do what you wanna, make me believe it
Ooo I wanna see ya get it shawty, get it shawty, get it shawty
Soo g-g-get it shawty, get it shawty, get it shawtyYou might also likeEmbed
