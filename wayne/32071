Remix baby

Shorty been eyeing me (Valentino)
She looking like she thinking about trying me (Haha)
She want it she can't take no more (Yeah)
I'm about to take her to my spot
I'mma get it hot she going, she going... (And let me)
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep (Hahaha)
She gonna let me (Ooh)
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I'mma tear it up when I
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep (That's right)
She gonna let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep
I'mma have her screaming like
Go, go, go, go, go, go (Come with me)
I'mma have her screaming like
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'mma tear it up

Yeah, hahaha, LUDA
She told me that she wanted to knock my socks off
So I slid my three-thousand dollar crocs off
She got her rocks off, and I got the cops off
In my fire red lamborghini, hot sauce
I was just a block off of Peachtree and Pharr Road, hey
I scanned her over like her booty had a bar code, hey
I made the car fold (yup) and then the car slowed
Weeooo weeooo wee, I went into alarm mode, ooh
Cause she was badder than the baddest of the baddestess
Her butt was fatter than the fattest of the fattestess
And I was glad it is, see what the saddest is
So I can take her home and she'll see where the apparatus is
Hey, in my private pool, yup her body drips dry
She was bare foot, I did her in my flipflops
Ooh, tick tock, the clock goes boom
So we quickly Luda-christened every room
LUDA

Bobby V, I got you
Hey baby, my name ain't Important
Umm, for now you can call me The Martian
Yeah, I need love like an orphan
So I could be your bug-a-boo, no arguing
Lil' mama let me beep beep like a motorola
Now I'm in love knee deep but it's at her shoulders
But being that I'm a G, I try to keep composure
But I swear shorty got me weak like the weekend over
From the window to the wall she get even lower
Yeah, she got the game, I'm just trying to keep the score
And I promise to be good and never leave it sore
And if I do I promise I will treat it more
Gentle the next time and neither/nor
Will I lie or cheat, either/or
Shit I'd rather beep like a freaking horn
And keep it blowing, aiight
Shorty been eyeing me (Oooooh)
She looking like she thinking about trying me (Trying me no)
She want it she can't take no more
(No more, no more, no more)
I'm about to take her to my spot (Moooore)
I'mma get it hot she going, she going...
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gonna let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
(She gon' let me beep)
I'mma tear it up when I
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
(She gon' let me beep)
She gonna let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I'mma have her screaming like
Go, go, go, go, go, go (Let's go baby)
I'mma have her screaming like
Go, go, go, go, go, go (Ohhh)
