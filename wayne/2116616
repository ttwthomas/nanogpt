1 ContributorIim so over you LyricsNo regrets at all, im high and I hope you catch the fall
Welcome to my lecture hall, you can't shake my infection off
Take me to your leader and I promise I will be the man
Swim until I see the sand then die soon as I reach the land
The waters over our hands, what happened to our plans
Swim until I see the sand then die soon as I reach the land
This is my resurrection so fuck your resolution
I don't need your protection, I don't need your confusion
Don't know what to believe, don't know what to believe
Don't know what to believe, don't care what you believe
'Cause im so over you, yeah im so over you
Yeah I fly over you 'cause im so over you
I did everything by the book (book), book (book)
Scribbling all over all of the notes that I took (took), took (took)
Find that you're no better than a crook, ooh
Setting the setup to fall like the twins you struck
Showed them a picture of my I.D
That ain't enough to prove that it's me
Look in the mirror, now who should I believe
This is my resurrection so fuck your resolution
I don't need your protection, I don't need your confusion
Don't know what to believe, don't know what to believe
Don't know what to believe, don't care what you believe
'Cause im so over you, yeah im so over you
Yeah I fly over you, yeah im so over you
