28 ContributorsDeath Wish Lyrics
They must got a death wish
Cause they was on the road to the riches
Back in the day, but they got off on the exit
Real disrespect shit
Whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment, it's hard to digest it
These young niggas don't wanna get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on 'em, and catch a bunch of cases
These old niggas still think they living in the 80's
And shorties that they knew since they were babies turned crazy
The bitches still holla at anybody lookin' like they gettin' a couple dollars
Could fuck, suck and swallow
Ain't nobody winning, but everybody can't lose
The dirt's still there, funeral home ain't move
Going in, coming out gang affiliated
You'd rather go back before being humiliated
A black cloud over the hood, you can't escape it
Dust smoking niggas walking 'round in the matrix
Loyalty is thin, the tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face when you mention a brick
Stick-up kids come around when they sense that you rich
Candles and lizzle get lit when you get hit with the fifth
Niggas that used to hoop dream is now selling the piff
And they still ratting but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the Tec spit
Fuck around get your head, and your neck hit, looking for a death wish
You might also like
Talking out your mouth, all reckless
To a nigga that you know, that'll let it off, that's a death wish
When your heart stops, and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time, that's a death wish
When you see the blood and realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from, that's a death wish
When you know a nigga, whole style's on some next shit
And you violate 'em that's a death wish

Young Money!
Ahh, I be on that way left shit
Better get right or get left shit
Better hit right or get left hit
Even if you threw the best pitch
Yes bitch it's Weezy-F bitch, I'm the best bitch
Motherfuck your guest list, I be like, let's just
Kill him and get breakfast, neck slit
Next shit expect this, every time you check this
I'm exit, I mean, excited to be your death wish
Bitch I wear this G shit on my heart, not my necklace
And I keep the Heckler for the hecklers
And I'm from the Mecca of the reckless with a record-breaking death list
The reckless and neglecters think the election won't affect us
I'm high above you, above law, above average
Niggas snitching, put niggas in a can like a beverage
Damn! I pop at your head, fuck up your memories
I put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
Yeah, if you don't remember shit you goin' remember this
I'm knocking niggas down this year, I'm on my timber shit
Big lion growl at you niggas on that Simba shit
I'll be on that "Fuck yo' clique, I'll kill every member" shit
Cold as December shit, bang in any weather shit
And they could buy your bag with body parts sold separate
Yeah, that's a bet bitch like Russian Roulette bitch
Weezy be the genie in a bottle, here's your death wish5Embed
