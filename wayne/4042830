15 ContributorsWeak Lyrics
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
Turn the music up a little bit in my headphones, please
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
Yeah, that's more like it, uh
Mhm, yeah
Got my nigga Dre in here with me, my nigga YoYo in here with me
I'm 'bout to talk to the shawties though

Ooh girl, you got me so weak
Ooh girl, your body unique, Amen, yes Lord
You an amazing lil broad
When you pass out wave and applaud, baby on call
Late at night spent on a beach
Hold hands and gaze at the stars, I play the guitar
When we fuck it's crazy, bizarre
She say I'm raising the bar
Her legs is ajar, her hair is a mess
She raising her arms, I stare at her breast, then I caress
And now she impressed, she say I'm the best, and I say I guess, and now she obsessed
And now she just text, with a request, to come be my guest, I said be my guest, have her W-E-A-K F-O-R W-E-E-K-S, I'm serious
I eat that pussy 'til she delirious, then she blow me like helium
Her tongue long, reptilian
Make love long, resilient, and then we spoon like cereal
And I came like four or five times, she just swallowed whole familia, and now I'm weak

(Yeah)
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
(Weak)

Yeah, I say girl I'm weak in the knees, I can't even feel 'em
W-E-A-K
What to do (weak)
All who's here, is you

Girl, where you going and where you coming from?
I could take you where you never been before
I make them hoes go back in they Pigeonhole
And turn the stress that you under into mistletoes
Girl you just perfect
And then we make a video, we sixty-nine on purpose
I mean it is what it is, and you get what you give, man
Don't you love reimbursements?
Girl it's just perfect
She dream about how good the dick is, and it's better in person
She said, it make her a better person
Even better, it make her a wetter person, rainy weather
I come first, she come last, and we came together
She said "ooh" I said "yes" like we sang together
Fuck her slow, fuck her fast, then I keep it mellow
She suck it slow, suck it fast, squeeze her cheeks together
Ooh, girl that got me so weak
Ooh, girl your body on fleek
I swear to god, your body should be illegal, and I'll catch the charge, hold up as I press record
I'm extra hard, you don't need no extra toys
It's Tunechi, bitch I'm freakazoid
That pussy I will destroy if it's hot pink and warm
I swear, I pinky swore, baby
Yeah
I say that pussy I will destroy if it's hot pink and warm
I swear, I pinky swore, baby
What to do (yeah)
All who's here, is you
I say now she weak in her knees, she can't even feel them
W-E-A-K
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak (yeah)
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
I say now she weak in her knees, she can't even feel them
W-E-A-K

Now you weak in the knees, you can't even feel them
W-E-A-K
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
(Mula)
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase
I want you to stay with me, by my side
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak1Embed
