3 ContributorsPut Me In The Game LyricsIntro:
Yeah Baby
Young money, Cash Money
Get my EA sports on, ya know wat I'm talking bout?
Yea
Verse 1:
I got a bus like John Madden baby
We can go all around the world
I never talked to them boys that sat on them benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And I'ma leave them boys at the line of scrimmage
Yeah I see these boys all behind me winless
I ain't Mario Williams but I'm not defenseless
Wide receiver catching Hail Mary's I'm Christian
5 and out hydraul yes we stick shift
Coming with the quick hits, fast with instincts
Cornerbacks, safeties, I burn 'em like incense
On the field I'm daddy and the ball is my infant
I don't need too much support but I'm in love with the pigskin
All I really know how to do is win
Super bowl champ, Disney World, let the kids in
Hall of fame Wayne, I'm putting my dibs in
Catch me in the game on fourth and inches

I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em
I don't, I don't talk to them boys that sat on them benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
Put me in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And I'ma leave them boys at the line of scrimmage
Verse 2:
Uhh I am a New Orleans Saint, and to the Houston Texans I'd like to say thanks
Reggie Bush baby! Reggie Bush baby!
Drew Brees, Marques Colston, Sean Peyton
I'm relentless, I'm offensive, I'm expensive, like Tom Benson
Super dome it's going down it's high time boys
We second lining on the fifty yard line boys
Hey quarterback I'm gonna bust through your line boy
Your jersey says your last name, but you mine boy
I'm so fast before I leave I been gone
Okay you in the zone, I'm in the end zone
Where is your chinstrap? Why isn't it on?
'Cause if I hit you you gone have to strap yo chin on
See the score on the goal line, it's on
Fourth and inches as the crowd chants this song
Chorus:
I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em
I don't, I don't talk to them boys that sat on them benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
Put me in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And I'ma leave them boys at the line of scrimmage1Embed
