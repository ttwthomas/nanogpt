Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a, can a drummer get
Can a, can a drummer get
Can, can a drummer get
(Can a drummer get some)

Boom, guess who stepped in the room
Dressed in black diamonds like a fucking monsoon
Back from the dead but they never found my killer
So I jumped up out the grave like Michael Jackson in Thriller
Iller than most MCs cause I be killin’ ‘em
Most MCs turn into ghost NCs
Yeah, give a drummer some
If 32 seville when that all black Hummer run
Face off, Nicholas Cage with a gauge
I’m famous for killing rappers, my style, grenade
Cook shit like Rae, the chef Raekwon
The beats are filet mignon without the A1
Who walk like a pitbull, You? bitch please
I ate your favourite rapper’s heart out with a 16
Didn’t hit the switch on something with big fiends
Make money with Ruff Ryders, homie, thats Swizz Cheese!

Can a, can a drummer get
Can a, can a drummer get
Can, can a drummer get

Uh, tune is chillin, ready and willing
Nigga I’m eating, happy Thanksgiving
Walking on the ceiling with my running shoes on
Life is too short, my money too long
Come into my zone, I’ma do you wrong
Life is an adventure; Indiana Jones
She a bad bitch, I give a dog a bone
My name is Weezy, baby, not Sylvester Stallone
And that's word to my drummer, word to my drummer
Talk shit, but my shit backed up, need a plumber
Colder than a bitch wearing furs in the summer
Digg deep in that pussy, search and discover
I’m a beast, pockets on obese
Police, I hate you so much right now, Kelis
It’s a Young Money show, go 'head take a seat
Red bandanna big B mothafucka
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
{Turn the music up dawg}
Can a drummer get some
Can a, can a drummer get
Can a, can a drummer get (Oh)
Can, can a drummer get
(Can a drummer get some) (GOD DANGIT)

They know me, yep, yep they know me
Back in the days I was the little homie
Now I’m doing good and they act like they don’t know me
Why the hell they always act phoney?
Yeah, I grew up from the roaches and the rats
They in my bed, I couldn’t stand that
Bread every night did I ever get away from that?
And all they worry bout is where my ice at
Damn, dog, where ya life at
Ya heard that I fell and you kind of liked that
You thinking that I owe you, but it’s not like that
Damn, you want the World but you gotta work for that
Chilling like a rock star, listening to ether
Bumping through your speakers, know I gotta heat this
Rockin’ don’t stop, you know I’m rocking don’t stop
Travis Barker make this whole place rock
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a, can a drummer get
Can a, can a drummer get
Can, can a drummer get
(Can a drummer get some)
Boss
Black Wall Street
Maybach Music
2Pac in Juice, Radames on the loose
10 chains 'round my neck, haters wish it was a noose
Long Maybach and I wish it was a coupe
Kush out the jar, car smellin’ like duke
Quarter milli on the seat, yeah I know I’m a goof
Designer underwear, she knows I’m a Gucc'
Got the wide body I’m a fat mother fucker
In Swahili I’m screaming “stack muther fucker”
Your homie won’t stop until I decide to
Until then I’m making rollies for the homies to ride to
Smokes on the folds, folks want to know
Bitch I’mma boss, best foots on the blow
Keep the hat pulled over, Big P on the front
Travis on the drums, big weed on the blunt
Being savage where I’m from, girls manage from the jump
Don’t trap me like a punk, Travis handing me the pumps, so

Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a, can a drummer get
Can a, can a drummer get
Can, can a drummer get
(Can a drummer get some)
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a drummer get some
Can a, can a drummer get
Can a, can a drummer get
Can, can a drummer get
(Can a drummer get some)2Embed
