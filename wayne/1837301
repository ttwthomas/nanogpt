11 ContributorsMIA Lyrics
This is well-developed music, haha
Khaled I see you, haha
It's Wheezy baby

One day up in M.I.A., hey
One day up in M.I.A., hey
One day up in M.I.A., hey
Until they re-build New Orleans
That's where I stay
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
Now shake ya ass for me, shake ya ass for me

I'ma South Beach soulja, hold ya horses
Porsche's, Rolls, Royce's
De-cisions, choices, make 'em
Puerto Rican face, but her booty is Jamaican
Breasts Brazilian, she, talk familiar
Her look will hurtcha, her walk will kill ya
Now I'm with Khaled, he got me a mansion
How come every girl up in here look like an actress?
Baby girl, if i find my camera, I'll point that thing directly at ya
My wrist is a bitch and my neck, a bastard
I rap but I don't get paid like rapper's
I'm fresh, I'm cool, dapper
All white tennis shoes, look like napkins
I'm strapped, yup I keep that clappa
I point that thing directly at ya
You might also like
One day up in M.I.A., hey
One day up in M.I.A., hey
One day up in M.I.A., hey
Until they re-build New Orleans
That's where I stay
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
Now shake ya ass for me, shake ya ass for me

Come tru ya town, ya know me, officer shot down
Hot girl l'wanna jump around for me sound
Fireman and burn the whole block down, say
Dontcha eva eva bring the fuck-boy around
Hustlin in the street, ya gotta make the cash money
Khaled lemme see ya workin for the Cash Money. ---- in 2007! god damn
Me so New Orleans, can't take that from me
But gangsta's don't die, they jus move to Miami
Yea, hop on the bike and peel
Come down Collins on one back wheel
Baby, I'm the hottest, and that's for real
Come to the condo, in ass and heels
Have a drink, have some pills
And make her think I'm Shaq O'Neal
If she won't tell, then I won't squeal
It's the sunshine state, and I'm glad I'm here
One day up in M.I.A., hey
One day up in M.I.A., hey
One day up in M.I.A., hey
Until they re-build New Orleans
That's where I stay
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
Now shake ya ass for me, shake ya ass for me

Okay we movin' baby
On our way to Little Haiti
I gotta chick with a baby
She cook curry-chicken and gravy
Lauderdale, hood as hell
But when I'm there, I'm good as well
Yeah, Dade County where you at?
Liberty City, and Opa Locka, in the back
Okay we movin' baby
On our way to Little Haiti
I gotta chick with a baby
She cook curry-chicken and gravy
Lauderdale, hood as hell
But when I'm there, I'm good as well
Yeah, Dade County where you at?
Liberty City, and Opa Locka, in the back
One day up in M.I.A., hey
One day up in M.I.A., hey
One day up in M.I.A., hey
Until they re-build New Orleans
That's where I stay
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
So, one time for the 3-oh-5, yea
Now shake ya ass for me, shake ya ass for meEmbed
