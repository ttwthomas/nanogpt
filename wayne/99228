It's Chubby Baby Ma I'm The Oh Seven Big
Guccis On My Feet
I Force Em Like I Post Em
When Your Money Reach Mine
That's When They Won't Smoke Ya
I Ride First Class
Phantoms With A Chauffeur
Bricks With A Trill Again Waiting On A Gofer (Ya Dig)
Soon The Order Finished
I'm Hopping In The Benz
I'm The Mid West Playa Boning All Ya Friends
When I Hit Magic City Make It Rain With The Ends
Then I Make It Thunder On My Neck Like Lightning
You Prayin On That Hit Play Boy Keep Writing
In The Club You

And the cars got engines like speed boats
Throw dough away like tickets to a free show, (uh)
