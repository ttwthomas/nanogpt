They drowning in the water, we can't save 'em
Blood all on the leaves and on the pavement
Weighs heavy on our brains and on our conscience
We know that tomorrow isn't promised

Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and
Put a price on his head, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed
Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and
Put a price on his head, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get...

I came from rags to riches, yeah
I'm talking Madden physics, yeah
From straight out of class to business, yeah
And I went from cash to digits, yeah
She stripping like that's religion, yeah
So I give her a cash baptism, yeah
I ain't into plastic bitches
But that bitch need some ass and titties
I can't smell that shit that's too skinny
I like my blunt fat and pretty
I'm smoking that Cali strong
I call that shit Calisthenics
You look like you got bad intentions
She look like she been paying attention
You look like you in bad condition
I look like I'm an air condition
Yeah, pressure busts pipes and I'm so piped up
Look at your wife and she gets mind fucked
I'm in the crowd, I make her eyes cum
Love is blind, so it can't find us
MDMA go MIA, MDMA and MIA
My little bitch naked like Kim K
I ain't got nothing on but some Kanyes
You got blood all on your sidewalk, on your sidewalk leave you sideways
I'ma blood walk on your sidewalk
I'ma slime walk in yo slime face
I'ma B walk on your sidewalk, on your front porch and your driveway
I put 10K on your head, my nigga said you ain't worth 5K, uh
You might also like
They drowning in the water, we can't save 'em
Blood all on the leaves and on the pavement
Weighs heavy on our brains and on our conscience
We know that tomorrow isn't promised

Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and
Put a price on his head, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get...

Then my diamonds start dancing
My houses is so killer, bitches call me Charles Mansion
Codeine, Adderal, Xanax, cars crashing
G3, G4, G5, I tarmac it
Dumb bitch, smart phone, calls dropped, she can't catch it
She get high all day, snort coke and drink Pepsi
Suwoo, Piru, this murder like Ja Rule
It's voodoo, it's taboo, my shooter shoot like Manu, pew pew
Achoo, I pray God bless you, I do
I lay you next to my shoe, don't get your flesh on my shoe
Run your mouth and we gon' slide, we slide
No lie I'm a blood repping 123
So 5, 45's and them 223's
And more 9's, Mac-10, 11's, 12-gauge
Numbers don't lie, lie
Run your mouth and we know it's
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies we know it's Sci-Fi
They drowning in the water, we can't save 'em
Blood all on the leaves and on the pavement
Weighs heavy on our brains and on our conscience
We know that tomorrow isn't promised

Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and
Put a price on his head, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed
Living life on the edge, pray the sunrise there and
Put a price on his head, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get fed, all the dogs get fed
All the dogs get...3Embed
