12 ContributorsLong Time Comin’ Lyrics
Yep, you guessed it
I came back
Ha, I came back around
Yeah, I came back
I came back, back, I came back around
Yeah!
So honored I am to have you back at the dinner table, feasters
Came back for seconds, people, yes!

Back door, back room, young nigga still switchin'
Young nigga still pitchin', naked bitches in the kitchen
Wishin' that I'd kiss em but I just missed em
Get my money, then I dismiss em
Lil' Marley still set trippin'
He got a bigger pistol now
He say he ain't missin'—you can't miss him
He's the skinny dude with da dreads, high yellow-red
That's always my blood, so we forever bled
You ain't got to go upstairs, you know what's up there
Bitches and cookware, hell yeah, fuck yeah
You know you smell dat cocaine, tough air
It's been a long time comin', but I come up fair
I ain't complainin'; I'm hydroplanin'
Let Capo smash the plaintiff
Now I'm over the sink, tryin' to think and find the kinks
To strengthen Italian links
There is no brakes, no alarms
Just guns, weed, triggers and bitches
The thicker the bitches, the bigger the brick is, shit
Niggas on some bitch shit but
(A change gon' come)
And when it do, you better get with it
Tha Carter 2 triple-exquisite
So bring your friends on your next visit—let's get it
The livin room still gata bunch of youngins in it
Jus waitin on a blunt to hit it and trill comin with it
And Blake probably in the basement on his calisthetics
And Tez probably in the office, bein a mathematician
That's catty-corner to my bedroom; lady in it
Who only wants Weezy' baby in it
Yeah, maybe when I finish gettin' this butter, I'll touch you
But I can't love you; I ain't Usher—I'm all Southern
All brother, you could call the authority
Got you wonderin' how; money got the law ignorin me
Yeah, like I ain't bringin in four a week
And I need more streets
The house need sheetrock
You could hear it all da way down the block
'Cause when you sleep not, we at work, pops
Ain't no stopwatch, ain't no clocks up
When we leave, all you gotta do is put the pots up
We eatin' cheese and bread, we stocked up
So you could put your eggs and tots up, it's not us
When I wake up, I pop up
Another day, another dollar—bitch, holla
This time I've exercised my power
So now I'm singin in da shower
A li'l deodorant, a lil' howard Johnson
Forty bags of powder, get the keys off the counter
I walk out the door and smell a flower
Now I'm about to go get into this album
