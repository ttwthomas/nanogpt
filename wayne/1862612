7 ContributorsReal Shit (All On Me) Lyrics
It's all on me, I do my dirt on my lonely
See most niggas fake and phoney
How my child gon eat?
Me and my dog riding on me
My mom kick me out
Where I'm s'posed to sleep?
Everything on me, since you want to put the blame on me
Fucking shame on me
Let it rain on me, that's on me
You're homo's, you're not my homie
First you was dickriding, now you riding on me
It's an A and B thing, C a way out my scene
Now all eyes on me
Weezy sat me down like this how it's gon be
We gon lock it down, slowly but surely
And you can count on me
See they waiting for the day that I sleep
See that's the day I'm a seep
Don't hold your nuts on me
Being pussy is something I ain't gon be
I'm 9th Ward, scarred hard
Take it or leave it, or let me take an Aleve
It's still all on you, like volume 2 BG
See me DT in a GT
Downtown as I'm G nice in a fresh white tee
See I'm a gangsta, you a wanksta
I'm a ridah, you just riding with her
I ain't a black belt, but I pack kick, like kung fu
Under the Gucci' black belt
See I know what I'm bout
Motherfuck what your bout
I know what I'm capable of... love, nigga
Run up in your house, gun up in your mouth, lights out
Nigga, I'm a shooter, shooter yea
I ride with the rider gang
I got mine, don't make me catch you at that stop sign
I used to chop dimes, cock iron, pop nines, shots fired, cops flying
My brunt, job done
Can't stop the shine, stop trying
You in the air, up there, better stop flying
Can't stop lying than better you stop liming
Before my goons put a stop to yo allowance
My whole alliance, fuck around the mid-range
Steering wheel alignment
Contract over ya head, yeah I signed it
And my little niggas taking the assignment
See these bitches never shut they mouth
These snitches never shut they mouth
My niggas and they not in jail and they need they bail
Who's gon' get 'em out
Ain't no telling when they getting out
Me I've been off the porch
Let off the leash, who the fuck let him out
Start running, Nutt coming
Mom I'm thugging, as long as you love me
I knew I was gon' be something because we came from nothing
I'm still a from the block, now they look around waiting to see me
Coming up the block cause I'm coming with enough bases to supply my whole block
Think I drew breeze the way I'm giving dome shots
Yeah and I can't stop and I won't stop
Unless I won't stop, I want the paper
Like I'm wanted by the cops
The generals salute me at the top and I ain't recruiting new niggas
Cause all you rappers lie
Like Fifty said man, get rich or die trying
So you could get rich but it ain't stop you from dying
Cause niggas still a snitch so ain't stop you from lying
My trigger finger itching ain't no stopping me from firing
Like Slim and Mack, can I ball, but
Slim got killed and Mack behind bars
Guess you find out who they really are when you really need 'em
Bitch wouldn't give me mouth to mouth just to keep me breathing
Now they wanna run they mouth when they see me
Run up to me, or run they mouth over who's seen me
Say they was like janitors they won't see shit
I told 'em I was gon blow, you should've fucked with me then
You might also like
Huh? damn...
Shit real like that, yah know what I'm saying


Fuck, my guitar coming
Okay now Deezle start drumming
And your toilet ain't clean enough for my shit
No hide and go seek bitch I'm it
Yeah, and now's the time
And my money old like wise LeBron
But it's Young Money and now's the time
So check your watch like Nike wrist wear
This year, and every year
Young Mula in your motherfucking area
Fuck a future mama, you are Miss Tonight
And I'm Mr. Right, now don't get left
Young F, yeah that what they call me
I like pussy in the night, the evening and the morning
Yeah I'm ready to drill her but in the clutch
I go downtown like Reggie Miller
Now stop and pop Reggie, I'm too fast
And I don't fuck with you turtles now Rock Steady
And BeBop I don't even claim to born
I'm a d-boy, I d-block, I destroy any block
From a treetop, pop pop, pop pop
Put you bitches in a box that make Laila Ali stop
