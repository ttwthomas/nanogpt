Gangsta Grillz
It's me and Spitta man
Gangsta Grillz, Mack Maine we see you
Young Capo I see you
Gangsta Grillz

I get that money that's my top commitment
Yall niggas just talking yall politicians
But let me get slick
Real quick like Rick
Without the patch on my eye
Take a patch out the sky, cause I’m fly
I say that a lot and Imma keep on
Thousand dollar jeans on nigga keep going
Keep walking, piece on
You won’t find me in my beach home
I’m out ya reach arm
I got a speech for ‘em, um
Fuck them and whoever know ‘em, one
I’m stepping in Roberto's with a nasty ass virgo
She feeling my gangsta, I ain’t even have to game her
But that came natural sort of like magical
I disappear when I dip in the bathroom
But I’ll be back soon fucking wit them raccoons
Like Jackie Gleason on his honeymoon
What up Fuke?
You might also like
Hot Spitter in the building
Young Money in the arena
Ya catch me with two bad bitches between us
(Gangsta Grillz)

I cook good crack in a pot in a pot i pissed in
Yall niggas just talking yall politicians
With the wind against my back I defend in the attack
By any man I’m in fact, ha ha
And its like that
My impact so hard if I die
I probably bounce right back
I walk around with a mice trap
Niggas wit cheese don’t like rats
And despite that
I been around a few gold fish
I’m still a shark out the ocean
I wear the fuck out the 0 6, 4 sent flow
Like I’m 4'6", left arm so stiff
Yall don’t shit about this stuntin’ business
I’m about to teach that to all of my bitches
But, back to the business
Give the mutha fucka so much coke
He probably have problems with they kidney
Spit ‘em
Jesus Christ
Young Money mother fucker
Money go way back
Way back like an old man hairline
Mu fucka y'all can't see that

It's haters out there but I"m optimistic
Yall niggas just talking ya politicians
I'm walking what I'm talking
And I'm playing what I'm saying
And I'm stepping what I'm reppin
I'm about what I shout boy
The loudest mouth of the South boy
I'm from the dirty dirty
You can't get me out my shop boy
I got a money clip but like what for
I tote whole stacks, they can't hold that
I stick it in her back pocket make her butt large
And pull her seven jeans down she like fuck drawls
And I'm like fuck that but she thought I was ignorant
Approached her like a gentleman
Her friends trying to get with him but
I already been with them
They all act the same I fucked them all
Man they like synonyms
I like dividends, I might give her them
She the niggas I'm with I might give her them
I don't know how he get so many girls, and rap
And handle like that, and the lyrics!
It's cool though, if y'all listening to him and y'all like all that
Y'all need to come get with me
Curren$y the Hot Spitta
The new gentleman
