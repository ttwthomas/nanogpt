8 ContributorsBig Dawg (Remix) Lyrics
I say money ain't a thing to a big dog
Ain't got nothing but some cash and my big balls
And I got my good and I got my guns
And I got my goons where the supposed to be
And I say murder ain't a thing to a big dog!
It go (POW POW) like a big dog
Hello world, I'm ready
Nigga ain't getting love from me!!

I'm in a Maserati and it cost one-forty
I'm a ghetto boy, I came up on Brad Jordan
I'm soaring in something foreign, shawty, fuck your boyfriend!
I am so fly, it look like I get dressed in a Hartsfield
Go head learn homicide, boy you know my car kill!
Orange and black Chevy, damn I'm ridin' Garfield
Standing by the bar, still running up my bar bill
Yeah I push weight, my bag feel like a barbell
I'm a big dog, look at my big dog watch
See we the big dogs that all the big dogs watch
Got this constipated flow, you know this shit's on lock
And shawty even when it's cold, they be like Tity Boi hot
Ya dig?

Shawty wanna go to the mall, so I took her
Keep it on the low, man, I just left her sister
More mail then the rest of the pushers
Because I got another bird in the bushes
Brick up, baby, the other shit whipped
I ain't with that, baby, drop top maybe
We can do a deal, something sweet like Sadie
If not, I'm getting money, it go "Fuck you! Pay me!"
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
If worse get to worst, we can just go to war
What'd you think all the guns is for?
Four 5's, four 4's, I'm fly, we soar high


Diamond around my neck, chest all iced up
Harley so fly, got my bitch the new matching truck
Birdman, you find one in every neighborhood
Get money, flip money, killing, understood?
Big whale, big fish and a big car
Hundred cars, parking lot like a movie star
Duffle boys, in every whip a nigga play
Alligator with the swade on them 28's
