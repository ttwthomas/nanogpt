1 ContributorThe Way I Are (Dance with Somebody) (Boy G Remix) Lyrics
I'm sorry, I'm not the most pretty
I'll never ever sing like Whitney
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
But I still wanna dance with somebody (Tunechi)

So let's let our hearts bleed, till they turn to rust
Gonna live it up, 'cause it's dangerous
No, I don't wanna play the part (Amen)
I just wanna dance with somebody (Amen)
I just wanna dance with somebody (Yeah)

I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody
Tell me, are you that somebody?
Don't matter who you are
Just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

I just wanna dance with somebody (Hey)
But I could never ever dance like Bobby (Hey)
You can dance, I'ma watch your body
I just wanna stand right behind it (Ooh)
I just want a chance with somebody (Yeah)
Pop a couple xans with somebody (Yeah)
Every time she dance it's exotic (Yeah)
Throw a bunch of bands arms get tired (Aye)
I'm the God I just want a goddess (Amen)
Gotta use a bedroom for a closet (Amen)
Got a whole bedroom, on the private (Bedroom)
I know her body inside, out science (Woo)
Kiss both boobs right before I sign 'em (Mwah)
Can't dance but kinda grind 'em (Mwah)
Yeah, I be right behind her, spinal (Aye)
We can turn this dance floor to a island (Yeah)
See Bebe Rexha LiveGet tickets as low as $36You might also like
I just wanna dance with somebody (Mula)
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody
Tell me, are you that somebody? (Tunechi)
Don't matter who you are
Just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

Bloody noses, speeding cars (Aye)
Lethal doses, desperate hearts
Roll it up 'cause we so ill (Ooh)
Heaven knows we love the thrill (Ooh)
No, I don't wanna play the part (Yeah)
I just wanna dance with somebody (Yeah; play the part)
I just wanna dance with somebody (Aye, yeah)

I just wanna dance with somebody (Mula)
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody
Tell me, are you that somebody? (Tunechi)
Don't matter who you are
Just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody (Oh)
I just wanna dance with somebody (Ooh, woah)
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody (Oh, woah)
Tell me, are you that somebody?
Don't matter who you are (Woah)
Just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebodyEmbed
