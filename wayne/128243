Rich Gang
If you hatin', you just need some pussy (Rich girl)
She fucked up when she gave me some pussy
I said, "I fuck you better than that other nigga"
She say, "Tune', I'm 'bout to cum," I say, "I'm cummin' with you"
She don't like them pretty niggas, sidity niggas
She ride this dick, her titties jiggle, that's my pillows
That's because I sleep in that ho, hit it when I wake up
Tell the pigs I say, "As-salamu alaykum," uh
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Sweet yellow-bone thing, I call her Honey Mustard
Pussy like a seashell, dick like a V-12
She say I drive her crazy, I say, "Just keep on your seatbelt"
Bend it over, bust it open for me
Baby, bend it over, bust it open for me, yeah
She say she love me, she just loves this dick
Come put that million dollar pussy on me, make me rich
Tunechi (Blatt)

She got that million dollar
Million dollar ooh, ooh, ooh
She got that million dollar
Million dollar ooh, ooh, ooh
And all I want to do is touch it (Touch it, touch it)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Make her tap out, tap out
Tap out, tap out, tap out (Yeah)
And I'ma make her tap out, tap out (All day, allnight)
Tap out, tap out, tap out (Yeah)

Jet made her tap out, pilot with the map out
Million on the diamonds, million on the kitchen
Millions on the Maybach, glass top ceilings
Million dollar pussy, sleepin' on Versace
Sleeping on Fendi, sleepin on Cavalli
Married to the money, millions in the bank
Alexander McQueen, rich in the paint

She got the million dollar seven-figure nigga rich
We switch positions like we doin' yoga in this bitch
She get to shakin' then stiff

Threw them hundreds 'til I lose counts on that ass
Max out all of them accounts on that ass
Million dollar checks, don't bounce on that ass

Million dollar ooh, ooh, ooh (Rich girl)

Tap out, tap out, tap out (Sweet D, love you, baby girl)
I'm in love with your Egyptian skin
And your talk 'bout religion
I’m in prison with the pussy
And I'm ballin', no cushion91Embed
