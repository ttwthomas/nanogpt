7 ContributorsI Feel Lyrics
What's happening?
The Hot Boy$ got some feelings they like to get off they chest
And if these niggas feel like we feel, then y'all niggas real
'Cause we feel like this here

I feel like niggas can't fuck with me
I feel like someone wanna be B.G
I feel Lil Wayne will burn yo block so quick
I feel Turk will be quiet and take yo shit
I feel Juve will catch you slipping and unload the tech
I feel a big ass helicopter on the set
Sometimes I don't even know how I feel
But I feel if you hating shit goin' get real
I feel like goin' buy me a brand new car
I feel like the neighborhood superstar
I feel like goin' buy me a new rolex
I feel this album goin' bring a big royalty check
I feel this nigga mad 'cause I fucked his bitch
I feel like this nigga could just suck my dick
I feel like we taking over the industry fo' sho
I feel like these bitin' wannabe soldiers already know
I feel like Fresh is the best at beats
I feel like when you hear this shit you goin' feel like me
You might also like
Nigga fuck you, I feel just like you
I said, nigga fuck you, I feel just like you
Nigga fuck you, I feel just like you
You fucking with the B.G., you fucking with the whole crew

I feel like niggas trying to size me up
I feel like niggas trying to bust me up
I feel like "Look, I can't be stopped"
I feel like me and my click too hot
I feel like hitting the block with four niggas
I feel like the whole CMB made niggas
I feel like hitting the ho after this 'cert
I feel like niggas can't fuck with Juve, Wayne, B.G., and Turk
I feel like we bout to blow up in this world
I feel like if I gotta hustle I'ma sell some 
Sometimes I just feel like jumping shop
I feel if my rhyme got beat, I'ma ride
I feel if a nigga flex up I pop the trunk
I feel like I could a nigga ho if I want
I feel like just getting it how I live
I feel like respect my mind lemme feel how I feel

Nigga fuck you, I feel just like you
I said, nigga fuck you, I feel just like you
Nigga fuck you, I feel just like you
You fuck with Lil' Turk, you fucking with the whole crew
I feel like I'ma lose my life for this
I feel like I'ma have to fight for this
I feel motherfuckers they goin' say I'm wrong
I feel niggas goin' get buck when they hear my song
I feel like puttin' 20's on up in my car
I feel like taking these bitch niggas to war
I feel I deserve me a platinum plaque
I feel I shouldn't have to ask for that
I feel y'all hoes know a nigga want here
I feel y'all bitches know I'm holding my dick
I feel y'all know I'm bout to hit me a lick
I feel like goin' to Texas for me some brick
I feel the policeman making me sick
I feel like the law don't wanna see a nigga with shit
I feel like walking on my judgement now
I feel like  on a budget now

Nigga I feel like, that everything I write somebody else will bite
I really think its cause all fresh tracks they be tight
I just can't explain, I feel like when 2000 come it'll be all about Wayne
I feel like the Hot Boy$ them should be the president
I feel like burning up yo body to leave no evidence
I feel like money is the most important thing to Ms. Cita
I feel like I should have no bald head tramp up in my Beamer
And I also feel that I'm also real
Ain't no rollie like my rollie, no one live like I live
And I, I feel that I'm one of a kind
I feel like niggas car shine but they ain't got features like mine
I feel like tonight I'm goin' ride, ride
And if you feel you goin' die, better hide
Now baby, baby, baby what the deal
Respect Lil Weezy mind I'm just telling you how I feel
Now look, how you feel Juve? How you feel?
I feel like a millionaire at all times
How you feel Baby?
I feel like popping mo' bottles than the law allow nigga fuck it
I feel like fucking all these niggas' bitches who be hating on me and I'm fucking 'em anyway
I just signed this deal, I just bought moms a new crib, and it's all good
I feel like bringing my car by 
I feel like letting 'em just bust that bitch out
I feel like making a come up in a mil'
I feel like getting that iron and go by myself
I feel like motherfuck the world
I feel like buying diamonds for my lil' girl
I feel like niggas need to stop stealing our shit
Ya heard me, stop stealing our shit
I feel like Mannie Fresh is the shit
I feel like Turk, I feel like Turk is the block burner
And I feel we taking nigga child if they hurt our feelings ya heard me?
I feel like fuck the world nigga
I feel these niggas need to stop stealing our shit1Embed
