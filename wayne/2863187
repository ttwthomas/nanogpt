Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girl...
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend

I don't know what y'all been told
Shawty Lo, back on the map, what's up, that's what's happenin'
And you know I keep work
Seventeen five, same color T-shirt, so what's happenin'
I'm the man, bitch, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
I'm hustling, got units in the city
If you want it, come and get it (haha) work (whoa)
Weezy from the N.O., (Ross) M.I.YAYO
When I go that way, you know I buy up all the yayo
Aye, and you already know
I been getting money way back in ninety-four

Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girl...
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girl...
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend

I talk big chips, ride big whips
Smelling like kush, walking through Sax Fifth
It's Rick Ross, my nigga Shawty Lo
All the bricks bought, we bought a lot of dough
They know it's me, they know it's me
I'm the man who touched the man for them forty keys
I'm the man sold them forty, went and bought a hundred piece
In the club, D4L and Triple C's, a hundred deep
You wanna beef, they wanna beef
Don't you know niggas die every day? That's where I'm coming from
Don't you know niggas stay in line when they see that Tommy gun?
That's a hundred, son, 'round a hundred, son
You wanna eat, they wanna eat
Ain't nothing free, my nigga, you gotta run the fucking streets
At least a week, see what you could move
You gotta move your feet if you want to fill these shoes
Ross

Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girl...
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girl...
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Look, old money, new work
Little coke in my gums like my tooth hurt
They from the red clay, I'm from that brown dirt
I love my baby mama and granddaddy Purt
New shirt, new jeans
New Bent, cost a nigga two Beems
That's two hundred thousand, nigga, you don't know nothing 'bout it
Got real niggas riding, fuck around, we bussing out it
It's Weezy, bitch, yeah, it's Weezy, hoe
Ray Charles' mama I don't even see the dough
Show me the money, show me the dough
I'm Lo, I'm C.E.O
Got stacks on deck, got hard, got wet
A bad bitch with me, I'm hard, she wet
Got raw, got white, got weed, got syrup
(That's what's happenin', haha!) Work

Bitch, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
Got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girl...
Got, got no wife, but the white be my girlfriend1Embed
