8 ContributorsDone It Now LyricsOh y'all niggas done fucked up now!
I ain't playin' wit' ya, patna
All bets is off, the truce is over, fuck the world!
I'm ready to die right here, nigga
(This shit fucked up, nigga)
This shit ain't even funny no more, patna!

You can see me cautious 'fore you see this Carbon 15, watch it I'll squeeze, just throw it up and keep coughin'
I'mma bring it out I promise they don't see it often
100 round bullets you can take the beam off it
The powder give you power while you gettin' geeked off it
'Til you 6 feet deep dead sleepin' in a coffin
I ain't playin' with these niggas fuck 'em, let 'em keep talkin'
Bet they patnas need suits after they bodies need chalkin'
Now you the raw
Separate the realest from the soft and you the flawed
I probably wouldn't a believed it 'til I saw it
Them niggas think they flossin' tell 'em step into my office
I'm feelin' standoffish homes, you better back off it
Bust that boulder on your shoulder, I'mma blow the back off it
Drop you off the bridge in Florida feed you to the dolphins
Cop 100 bricks in Georgia drive 'em to the office
And if I bag 'em up in ounces better get a mil' off it
Trippin' off some bullshit you better chill off it
Tryin to beef and start some bullshit to get a deal off it
Niggas gon' be killed off and they mamas out here lost it
And now they mothafuckin' life it's gonna cost 'em, nigga

You bearin' witness to the latest and the greatest
You should listen to the latest 'cause them sucka niggas hatin'
Hands down best, shit, the realest ever made it
Land in a jet, Tre'mel, we done named it
Ride in Ferraris, drops, Bentleys and Mercedes
They envy the nigga's swagger
Would die for the nigga, playa
Yeah they gettin' mad but I don't wanna do favours
Nigga I'm too major
Talk to you later
Already hated you and gettin' more paper
Now how you think they take it he the best on paper
Gracin' the front pages?
Pay attention to the latest
You ain't heard the word? Better listen to the ladies
King of the whole thing, no ifs, no maybes
But the game so crazy
Niggas is so shady
Tryin' to play fair niggas think it's so crazy
That's when the arm raise and the guns gon' blazin'
Cajun, sizzlin' hot it gone crazy
Playin' hard ball you diggin' yo own grave and
If the police get you 'fore me it's O.K
We gon' have a nigga fuckin' you in the prison wit' AIDS
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin' round?
Hunt 'em down
I want them niggas dead
I want they head I want it now
I'mma put you in the ground, nigga
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin' round?
Hunt 'em down
I want them niggas dead
I want they head I want it now
I'mma put you in the ground, nigga

I'm a bullet past cuckoo
And I be wit' a bunch of dogs, no goof troop
And I'm the shit I stay away from the poop scoop
Fuck wit' me I turn you to angels like Snoop Snoop
You catch shots like the hoop do
The bullets spin you around and hula hoop you
And I don't give a damn who you
See all you hear is "Brrrap! Brrrap!" and "Su-whoop!"
Do you
Know what I do t'you
Or what I'd do to the child you grew
I'm wild, so zoo, like I'm Japanese
If niggas wanna jump they fuckin' with the trampoline
And when the block hot I come through like mezzanine
The fireman, hoe, I smell like gasoline
I got somethin' on the flo' that would blow you to smithereens
Head, arms, feet, brains, heart, liver, spleen
Bitch I'm clean
In the city where niggas be droppin' like Fonzie
Wake your ass up, bitch, nigga you not dreamin'
Pussy-ass boy die screamin'
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin' round?
Hunt 'em down
I want them niggas dead
I want they head I want it now
I'mma put you in the ground, nigga
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin' round?
Hunt 'em down
I want them niggas dead
I want they head I want it now
I'mma put you in the ground, niggaEmbed
