1 ContributorHit The Lights LyricsYMCMB, bitches call me Tunechi Li
All them bitches think they fly
And all 'em bitches flew to me
Hit the lights so you could see
My drink is strong and my hooka sweet
Understand the time is now, but time is up the futures bleak
Its me, its stupid cupid
Love me, leave me in the morning
If you like your friend can join in
The wildest flower in the garden
Coolest nigga in the party
Shades on, dreads long
Blood gang, red zone
And I'm with Jay SeanYou might also likeEmbed
