1 ContributorI’m Boss (Remix) Lyrics(YOUNG LIFE)
Capital B I'm a Boss
Hit the mall buy shit without seeing the cost
I'm on some fly shit
Got a 6.3 Benz with a white lip
There's a plane on the street bitch and im the pilot
Get your calculators nigga I'm a problem
Fuck goons big homie my killas is goblins
Platinum off the neck with a lot of diamonds
While they tryin to rob me, I'm try to rob them
Ima California native a westside rider
Fuck it homie call me a dragon I flow fire
Diarrhea flow go get them like flo diapers
Send a gangsta a pen cuz I really no lifers
Haters wanna merk me feds wanna lock me
So we up early showing bullets in the thirty
I outcast homie middle finger to the world
Just tryin to get this deal Wayne said i'll be their shortly
(CHORUS)
Bitches say that I'm a boss cuz of what they see
And all the wankstas outside tryin to hate on me
Cuz they know I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Yeah they know I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
(LIL WAYNE)
Uh hum mothafucka I'm me
And mothafuck P O L I C E
Me in all flavors make a bitch do favors
Turn your life into a wager
Hope your homies got some paper
Fuck it Ima gunna from the east side of the New Orleans
Where we eat all the beef and put the bullshit in the toilet
Put the choppers in the Harley
I mean choppers not Harleys not Harleys
Like a cop I popup and stop parties
I'm shorty when they call me but you can call me boss
And I'm on them trees like moths yeah
Get up on your mouths like floss yeah
I'm all over this shit like sauce yeah
Blood gang bitch Lil Wayne rich
And you bitch niggas can't tell Lil Wayne shit
Yeah stunt like my pa
And I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far

Bitches say that I'm a boss cuz of what they see
And all the wankstas outside tryin to hate on me
Cuz they know I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Yeah they know I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
(PAUL WALL)
I'm at the top of the food chain
And bitch I'm getting hungry
Flossin up in this boss hog
I'm swangin like a monkey
Yes im too trill
Watch chain and grill
Flo game is ill the champion so real
Even when I was little with candy on power wheels
And Ima still hold it down until im over the hill
Chasing after dollar bills so I can smoke and pop pills
And pop the Gucci seal off the paint is feel
I learned to be a boss from my boy Slim Thug
Marbles double doors and big old Persian rugs
These haters need a hug tryina knock my game
I'm just hustler maintaining cashmoney like Lil Wayne
Im chasing after cheese with my homeboy Jeez
While chrome drop the Bentley top
We call it that strip tease
I must admit God has blessed me like I sneezed
And all the haters talking dime can suck these
Cuz bitch I'm a boss
(CHORUS)
Bitches say that I'm a boss cuz of what they see
And all the wankstas outside tryin to hate on me
Cuz they know I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Yeah they know I'm a boss (I'm a boss)Embed
