And if that pussy so and so then I won't hit that bitch twice
You heard about what's-her-name who ran off on the plug, right?
Caught him and they opened up his top like a muglite
Posted in the spot, look like a zebra with these damn stripes (Young shit, nigga)
Hopped out the Porsche like, "Fuck The Source"
I still ain't get them five mics (What's up?)
Find a nigga better, if you let a nigga know the nigga
Yeah, I hear the shit they talking, it ain't like a nigga slippin'
Nigga I can make it hustlin and I can make it rappin' (Yeah)
On the gram with a pic, now that's a mean caption (Haha!)
Now what you know about that 36 (Six), I can make it double, hoe (Double)
They hit you when you ballin', they don't see you when you struggle though

I put them O's in the microwave (What's up?), but you ain't 'bout that there (What's up?)
Talk a whole brick of white today, but you ain't 'bout that there
Got that Muller on my wrist today (What's up?) but you ain't 'bout that there (Yeah)
