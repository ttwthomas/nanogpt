8 ContributorsBoys at War Lyrics
Guerilla, what? What?
Untamed guerilla

Everyday I hear somebody bustin' choppers
They be makin' it hot, they be killin' my block
They be havin' them whole old people scared up
They be havin' them lil' children scared duckin'
But they don't give a fuck, they wanna see whats up
Niggas done play wit' his people Now they gone bust'em up
Some of them snortin' dope, some of them bag that kill
Some of them jus bout that foolishness some of them play it evil
I remember the club, they got banged up
Nigga was in the middle of it wit' his brains bust
And his partner saw, all of them niggas face
And now they wanna turn the tomorrow into a murder case
Nigga get out of jail, he still be up in beef
Gotta get some money, gotta get him a piece
Gotta get him a low so he can beef up
Catch a nigga down bad and wodie gettin' stuck

Them boys at war, I say them boys at war
I say them niggas from uptown, them boys at war
I say them boys at war, I say them boys at war
I sat them niggas from downtown, them boys at war
I say them Cash Money niggas, I say them boys at war
I sat them niggas from downtown, them boys at war
I say them boys at war, I say them boys at war
I say them Hot Boy niggas, yeah them boys at war

Huh? Nigga, what? What?, Walk it like you talk it nigga
Wayne's sparkin' nigga, bulldogs be barkin' nigga
This is the army nigga whoa wodie keep it cool
Fo I get full of the C and D and take out me and you
See personally, I can't see when them niggas out to murderin' me
So I spin blocks in Bentley's, keep'em from murderin' me
Me and the butcher knife killa, two wild loose guerillas, untamed guerillas
Nigga where y'all at?
I'm a lil' tiger and I wear all black
Full of that fire and I puff 'til its gone
Boy I'ma a rider, strap up 'cause it's on
What? Niggas think it's cool to not wear a vest no mo'
Boy in this war, you want eve much have a chest no mo'
Y'all boys ain't ready to get lost in cross fire
Never them toss  Weezy neva die

Them boys at war, I say them boys at war
I say them niggas from uptown, them boys at war
I say them boys at war, I say them boys at war
I sat them niggas from downtown, them boys at war
I say them Cash Money niggas, I say them boys at war
I sat them niggas from downtown, them boys at war
I say them boys at war, I say them boys at war
I say them Hot Boy niggas, yeah them boys at war
Now it was drama going on in my neck of the woods
Beef kickin' through out the hood niggas up to no good
Look here, they strappin' up, click clackin' up, loading them thangs
Niaggas are taggin', they backin' up, they lettin' 'em hang
My niggas walkin' up, pullin' up, fuck a drive-by
'Cause the nigga on the passenger side automatically die
Capable to slide, wit' a U-P-T
You out of bound, you ain't from uptown, cross Martin Luther King
Its pistol play on up and up
Niggas being big-mouthed so they gettin' tossed up
You better be about yo business 'cause it's going down
Niggas gettin' out, two weeks later they body found
I can't be fuckin' with them niggas drawin' beef to me
Have me in shoot outs that don't concern the B.G
I play it like the next nigga fuck he play it raw
But I gotta watch my fuckin' ass 'cause them boys at war, them boys at war

Them boys at war, I say them boys at war
I say them niggas from uptown, them boys at war
I say them boys at war, I say them boys at war
I sat them niggas from downtown, them boys at war
I say them Cash Money niggas, I say them boys at war
I sat them niggas from downtown, them boys at war
I say them boys at war, I say them boys at war
I say them Hot Boy niggas, yeah them boys at war
Camoflaugin' undisguise on the hit
Hummer's we drivin' and in it yo boy told us we ain't playin' wit
Nothin' but head busta, thats who I roll wit'
Hangin' from coppers wit' choppers givin' a fuck, we hit
Bitch, them boys at war in the nolia
Niggas be shell shocked Knockin' heads of a shoulders
Many MAC-10's, grenedes blowin' shit up
Troopers be on roofs wit' scopes shootin' shit up
Head shots what they givin' no surrenderin' you never die
Spin in the bed, in the rover wit' the six tires
Cuttin' throats leave'em hangin' like ropes
Dead bodies is what you find, niggas be dying slow
Killa's gone ride wit' lows
My nigga L be teamed up
S-K's fifty shots and choppers
Nigga its nothing descent in this battle donkey
Untamed guerillas and bout leaving you funky

Them boys at war, I say them boys at war
I say them niggas from uptown, them boys at war
