4 ContributorsDrought Interlude Lyrics
Aye man, intermission yuh
Y'all still tuned into Da Drought
Right before the package, February 2004, Tha Carter
For as of now, the streets will hurt until my arrival, sorry
The dawn, the Prince, the King, I'm the King
Aye everyone! I'm the King, I'm the King tell 'em

 in this motherfucker
I'm in this motherfucker, hot up in this-
I don't care who not up in this motherfucker
Fuck boy, get shot up in this motherfucker
Pop up in this motherfucker
Hot up in this motherfucker
Call the Doctor in this motherfucker
How can one human be so sick?
Immune to your bitch, ah
Move In the club with the tool on my hip
Watch how you dab me off, the strap might go off
Let me take it back for y'all
Like the '77 daddy Cadillac with walls
But I'm creepin' through the back, I'll be back for y'all
This is bass, this is crack, 
Ain't no cases around here gettin' cracked, or solved
'Cause ain't no niggas 'round here about to crack at all
Wheezy Baby, nigga
I got that dope like crack,  yeah
You might also likeThe dreads out the rubber band, I don't care
Got that can in the other hand
And I ain't pop it in the air, no
I ain't singing this for him ah
Mean what I say and say what I feel
I lean 'cause the K heavy weight on my left
Y'all mean, couldn't block these shots himself
I ride clean in the drop top, 82 dealt
With the baby blue animals, the baby blue 
The baby blue walkin', the baby blue 
I might rock the baby blue will
She said 'Baby you silk', ah
Leave that pussy soaked
Oh baby you will
Stop stuntin' that bitch for a bribe at the bar
Lil 
'Bout to drive that car, we on our way man
Coming from the state of Louisiana
I'm great, pick money, heavyweight
That I know you niggas heard about
But tell me something, you see us heavily fucking
So why would you ever fuck with the dirty South?
Da Drought

That's cool Mama!Embed
