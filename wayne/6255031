3 ContributorsA Millie Remix Lyrics
Bangladesh
Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridgе, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by thеm goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Yeah
Motherfucker, I'm ill
Wayne, I'm goin' in (militia, yeah)
You might also like
I'm illy in here with them Young Money millionaires
Think you really pop a wheelie in air?
Mac Milli, the Vanilli's in here
I'm a rascal, don't get whopped
I get brats who don't give top
I get tassel, pass you with a flow you could never put a brake on
And I break on anything a n***a take on
Feel the napalm from my trey arm, straight long
Throw a n***a like I'm Akon, 'cause I'm acorns
Where the base gone? Get the base blown, let the pistons on that chopper
Come on, cops, I'm kamikaze, drop a rock with them Obamas
Illy in the mind, really with the nine, millie when I rhyme
Silly anytime fine, chilly, gitty on the grind
Shitty on a dime, Penny on the line
Plenty's in me, any guinea's with 'em
Bigger than a mini, and remind I'm
Illy, and it's all off G.P.s and a PG walk by, beep-beep
Need a freak, skeet, hawk out, big feet on a Jeep
She taught by Weezy F
We be the best, truly to death, prove me the rest
Groupies confess, you be the ref, 'excuse me, I left (haha)

Kiss my ass, n***a
I'm a D-Block general (uh-huh)
I be bringin' paper in (yup)
Caught a bad deal in the beginning, now I'm rapin' them (haha)
Pulled the Chevy out for the summer on 28's again (dumb)
What is he drinkin'? What is he smokin'? How he makin' them? (Sour)
How's he been nice for so long, why they hatin' him? (Why?)
Got him doing time, in the box, isolatin' him
Got money, and he love pressure, they ain't brakin' him (I love it)
Tight shirts, tight pants, all these homo-sapiens (haha)
All these n****s is trash, and they over ratin' them (all these niggas)
Put 'em in the booth with me, I'm annihilatin' them (annihilatin')
Who ever you think is pumped up, I'm inflatin' 'em (yeah)
Jail n****s, n****s in the hood, I relate to them (woo)
Blood money, and drug money, I was caking them (uh)
There when they broke the pies down, they was baking them (uh-huh)
My enemies, I wish them all luck, and I pray for them (I wish them luck, pray)
'Cause whenever we cross paths, that'll be the day for them (day)
Thompson's, M16's and AK's for them
Can just get one, bullets like Frito Lays for them (haha)
Closed casket, leave nothing but legs for them (damn)
Fuck mercy, no need to beg for them (uh-uh)
Yeah, just let the Devil deal with 'em
Uh, and the other n****s that squeal with 'em
Haha, fuck boys do fuck shit
I wasn't before, and I'm still not to be fucked with
What?Embed
