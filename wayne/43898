3 ContributorsHey Ya Lyrics
Can't you tell we about to take over the indusrty
And lock this motherfucka up like penitentiary
If u don't know nobody else you don't know C.M.B
Me, Mannie Fresh, Lil' Wayne and Turk, Baby and B.G
The H.B.'S with Strings on the cd-Its all gravy
Wait till you see us on TV
I'm Juvenile it ain't hard for you to see me-a arrogant nigga
With golds on my front teeth, front teeth

Always saggin' never catch me with a suit on
Nigga I'm only 17 but you'll think that I'm grown
I'ma lil nigga 5'8 wit 2 slugs ready to kill niggas
Who give me mean mugs got niggas who down now ride wit me
Hit a block wit Glocks and start a riot wit me
For Turk my nigga-Baby-drive change on your soldeirs
Got niggas all over knock your head of your shoulder
{Chorus}(Baby)2x
Hey Ya,Hey Ya,Hey Ya,Hey(Truly Beautiful)
Hey Ya,Hey Ya,Hey Ya(Truly Beautiful)
Hey Ya,Hey Ya,Hey Ya,Hey(Truly Beautiful)
Hey Ya...Hey Ya
