Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yay, come and give it to me
I'ma make it clap, clap, clap, ain't no itty bitty
If you got a lap, I'ma sit, real pretty
I'ma make it clap, clap, clap, ain't no itty bitty
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yay, come and give it to me
You could drink it straight from the tap, lick the kitty, kitty
Can he catch it if I throw it back? That's a fifty-fifty
I'ma make it clap, clap, clap, ain't no itty bitty

She got a thick-ass ass with fake-ass titties
She like a straight-ass man and gay-ass women
I like a bald-head cat, so shave your kitten
She leave my tommy gun slimin' slime, my Draco drippin'
Fuckin' right, bust it open for a bust-down
Yeah, up, down, up, down, up, down
Cut down on the syrup, now I'm up now
Sike, I could hit it without putting the cup down
I'ma go brazy in there, shoot babies in there
But she ate 'em for dinner, she a baby killer
I'ma make her run laps like track (Run track)
Put my face up in her lap like a MAC, ooh

If you got a lap, I'ma sit, real pretty
I'ma make it clap, clap, clap, ain't no itty bitty
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yay, come and give it to me
You could drink it straight from the tap, lick the kitty, kitty
Can he catch it if I throw it back? That's a fifty-fifty

Ooh, close your eyes 'cause they rollin' back
I'ma close my eyes and imagine you is Doja Cat
Make that ass clap until it do the Nolia Clap
I got on the twenty four karat gold Trojan hats
Sit up on my lap, 'til we overlap
You got on the camouflage thong, got a soldier rag
If these wall could talk, I got your pussy walls talkin' back
Made you leave them bug-a-boos alone like the Orkin Man

Girl, yeah, make you oh, na-na-na-na-na-na
Stop whinin', this ain't Amy Winehouse
I'ma fall in it then climb out
Make you shimmy, shimmy, ya-ya-ya
Yeah, shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yay, come and give it to me
I'ma make it clap, clap, clap, ain't no itty bitty
