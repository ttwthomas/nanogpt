6 ContributorsBy Your Side Lyrics
By your side boy here I stand
If you're looking for a lover baby here I am
By your side boy here I stand
If you're looking for a lover baby here I am

Yeah, she my baby, she my boo, she my rider
She my shoon, she my girl, she my ?
Plus she never tried me I never tried  her
And I don't think I need another girl besides her
It feels good cause I know she loyal, I know she mine
She mine only, she must have told me 100 times
And I believe her, I trust her that's why I'm always trying
To make her smile with the small things, a little time
A nice bag, a nice heel the right car
Make it a verse so my baby could up at the stars
Pink sweat suits, lapearla drawers girl I'm still trying to find a flaw

By your side boy here I stand
If you're looking for a lover then baby here I am
You got my heart in your hands, if you need me boy come see me and we'll work it out...

She wear her hair down, a part in the middle
Always been Dwayne carter, part in the little
Caught in the middle of her smile, I smile back
I've known to ask forever, it was a while back I met her
On a Saturday, wait, was it Friday
Whenever, I ain't tripping I'm just saying she was this ball player's girl
I ain't gonna say names
I only saw her when that nigga had away games
Then we got closer, while he was miles away
You know what it is, white wine
She do hair makeup so she was groomed well
Love is in the air, and that's what the room smell like
And I just get behind her like 2 tail lights
I hope you ain't exhausted, 2 tail pipes
She fell right in my hands and
We start over right back where we began

By your side boy here I stand
If you're looking for a lover then baby here I am You got my heart in your hands
If you need me boy come see and we'll work it out

Babe what you saying ha?
Shawty down for a ?
I'm talking right or wrong
Like if I'm locked up, she waiting by the phone
Any situation, just standing by the throne
I'll be her King though my power turn on
Homie love too I'm always in the mood
And when she be the same, we make it do the do
Sugar kisses and hugs, Alexander McQueen
Peach polo, but the product is cream
Pony tails and love ?
She looks so good but yet so bad
I'm on the road reminiscing bout home
Everybody needs a back bone, shit

By your side boy here I stand
If you're looking for a lover then baby here I am
You got my heart in your hands
Give me colors, dreaming boy, press work it loud1Embed
