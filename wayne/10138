4 ContributorsTell Me Lyrics
And these hoes still lickin niggas earrings and shit, diamonds and shit
Nigga break it up, rock it up, bake it up
That's what homeboys do when they tryin to see somethin
Nigga shake it up, warm it up, cut it up
Playboy, won't you help a nigga come and move somethin
Nigga tint it up, rim it up, paint it up
That's what Cash Money do when they go and buy somethin
Nigga spend it up, drink it up, throw it up
That's the Cash Money motto, we don't give a motherfuck
Nigga shoot it up, boot 'em up, snort it up
That's what homeboys do when they beefin or somethin
Nigga makem' up, stack it up, jack it up
That's what playboys do when they come up on somethin
Nigga ice it up, dress it up, bezel it up
That's what Cash Money do when they lexin or somethin
Hoes suck it up, lick it up, drank it up
That's what hoes be doin tryin to come up on somethin

Tell me what kinda
Nigga got diamonds that'll, "BLING", blind ya
Tell me what kinda
Nigga wear Roleys that'll out-shine ya
Tell me what kinda
Nigga got diamonds that'll, "BLING", blind ya
Tell me what kinda
Nigga wear Roleys that'll out-shine ya

Now now, it's Lil Weezy steppin on the gas, so smash
I don't mean to drive fast but I'm in a Jag
Catch me speedin up the block flossin, showin my golds
Wit me drop top ridin 'til me pipes explode
Got a vehicle wit games in it
30 thousand dollar Rolex wit Wayne in it
Got a Benz and a truck, 20 on my feets
Plus a house by the beach that I barely see
Man this the life behind the wheel of a Diablo doin 90
Boltin my doors up so that you can see me shinin
Tymer tymer, think you can phase, not hardely
I'm still a rider, and I tote K's, can't harm me
I pass ya block up, ya son amazed, but I'm sorry
It ain't my damn that ya'll ain't never saw a Ferrari
But you can check it, I ain't gon' even much sweat it
I'm headed to the casino wit 3 G's doin better

Tell me what kinda
Nigga got diamonds that'll, "BLING", blind ya
Tell me what kinda
Nigga wear Roleys that'll out-shine ya
Tell me what kinda
Nigga got diamonds that'll, "BLING", blind ya
Tell me what kinda
Nigga wear Roleys that'll out-shine ya
You could take the ugliest broad in yo city
Dress her up and make the ugly duck look pretty
Meet number one pimp, playa
From the Himalaya, broads love the way I say a...
Mack-a-docious super knockout rap
Sittin in the club wit ya bitch in my lap
Now that's a cap
Guess who's comin to dinner
Captain weenie wit a beenie, best believe he finna'
Stick a pickle dead up in yo mouth
Work it in and out
If you gon' scream, then scream, if you gon' shout, then shout
Your name should be Orel cause the thangs you do
Orel suck-a-pickle, yeah dat name fit you
Ya yuckey don't miss a dropped star
I love it when ya do me in back of the car
You's a hot heated porno shooter, sex tutor
Barracuda, standin in the nud-a
Girl you da, reason why my dick standin heavy
Fuckin in the Chevy
House, lake in front levy
I want to dedicate this song to all the  named BettyEmbed
