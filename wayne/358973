5 ContributorsKing Kong (Remix) Lyrics
If you hear me before you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me (3X)
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me
I got king, I got king kong in the trunk

Ay Yo This Beat Is Bannanas
Gave King Kong A Tree And Put'em In The Trunk Of Da Mcclaren
So When The Doors Lift Up They Fall Off
Take A Look At My Ride You See The Doors Is All Off
Plus The Wheels Look Flat, Trunk So Heavy In The Back
Got The Speakers In The Front And They Be Sittin On My Lap
Got The Bumpers To The Ground
Cause The Trunk Weighin It Down
They Think It's A Low Rider When They Come From Outta Town
And That's Cause King Kong In The Trunk
Plus The Gorillas Behind Me
So When I'm Commin Thru Yo Hood Anybody Can Find Me
You Can Hear Me From The Next Block
When I'm On The Next Block, When I'm Headed To The Next Block
So Jump Into The Next Block
You might also like
If you hear me before you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me (3X)
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me
I got king, I got king kong in the trunk

Lil Mama Got Stompin And Jumpin
When The Base Start Bumpin
So I Told Her She Wasn't Talkin Bout Nuttin Man She Just Frontin
You Can Hear Me From A Block And You Already Know What's Up
With The Women Cause They Feelin How It Rumble In My Trunk
I Got Plenty Speakers Up In My Trunk And I Turned It Up
And All The Ladies Loving How It Be Bumping
They Can Hear Me Out, You Can Hear Before You See Me
I Got Beats Up In The Trunk
All The Ladies Want To Chase Me When They Hear My System Bump
Say Jibbs I'm About To Head Out To The Lou And
Holla At You About Dat Fedy, Hit My Celly Soon As You Ready
Let's get This Cheese Like A Deli
They Thought I Was A Lunatic When I Pulled Up To The Telly
I Had That Candy Coated Chevy, Showing It's Grill Like It's Nelly
And The Ladies Love Me Why Is That
They Love The Way I Be Getting My Lean On
Yellow Diamond Ring, And Get A Multi Colored Diamond Bling On
Got That King Kong, Yea I Bet Ya This Gon' Be The Theme Song
Cause That King Kong Will Have Your Ears Ringing Like A Ring Tone
If you hear me before you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me (3X)
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me

Bumpin Hard And My Bass So Strong

My Chain Hang Low And My Diamonds So Clear

And A New S.5 50 No Car Note
And They Both Candy Painted Chromed Out On Thumps
And They Both Sound Like I Got A Woman In Tha Trunk

King kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong

King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me
I got king, I got king kong in the trunk

Ay Jibbs This Ya Playa Partna From St. Louis Man Chingy
You Kno Tha S.S Got Fo' 15's
The Range Rover Gotta Couple 12's
And Tha Hemi Speaks Jus Beats Crazy
But I Got That Sierra Coupe Thing That New Thang Let Me Talk About It Man
Five 50 Vins Chrome Rims I'm Hurtin Da Streets
It's So Luxury Tha Windows Got Curtains You See
I'm Ridin Fly While Ya'll Walkin And Hurtin Ya Feet
Cats With Factory Radios Look Nervous To Me
As I Pull Up 6 12 My Purp Is Ta Beat
I Puff Light So I'm Rollin Up Purple And Cheese
Woofers Bout To Bust Like A Holdas Been Workin Da Streets
Police Gave Me A Ticket Said I Was Disturbin Tha Peace
King Kong Fightnin Godzilla
Car Rattlin And Shakin How I Ride Nigga
Ballin Park Mark Nutty North Side Niggas
Yo System Gon Bang Like Mine So I Dry Niggas
Speakers Soundin Like A Band Playin Live Nigga
Twilight And Some 20's On Your Ride Nigga
And 28's Have Me High In The Sky Nigga
If You Hear It 'for You See It That's Iight Nigga, Chingy

If you hear me before you see me
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me (3X)
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
King, king kong, king, king, king, king kong
If you hear me before you see me
I got king, I got king kong in the trunkEmbed
