2 ContributorsStreets Raised Me Lyrics(Verse)
You are now tuned in
Pushed me out the box, you’re tryna keep my tool in
Young swagger on rewind, they letting Mr Cool in
2-40s on my waist, now come the two twins
Big money got me in this new Benz
Got my fake homies hatin, probably need new friends
So I added Benjamins and a bunch of damn Jacksons
So these niggas ain’t free, sup Tony Braxton?
No, I ain’t actin, I ain’t comin with no movie scripts
But if on a roll a director start shootin shit
Skeet got me pumpy, told me Buck just do yo shit
Release me off the leash and watch the beast start chewin shit
(Hook x2)
They hatin, I’m cakin
I’m caked baby, my money on, be crazy
Switchin up my hustle, get this money on the daily
Switchin up my style to get this cake on the daily
(Verse lil wayne)
Young money cash money til I’m killed nigga
Bet my funeral be over packed with real niggas
Started on a black top with a few pieces of crack rock
Now it’s just him pumpin his motherfuckin black rock
Earn my stripes like a motherfuckin black sock
Now it’s like we hit the motherfuckin jackpot
Hurricane Catrina is the motherfuckin back drop
Man you know them niggas got that motherfucker back hot
I’m tryna see how to get that new book, rock black drop
I’m a PI a’ight? A’ight
You might also like(Hook x2)
They hatin, I’m cakin
I’m caked baby, my money on, be crazy
Switchin up my hustle, get this money on the daily
Switchin up my style to get this cake on the daily
(Verse)
I’m from the gutter where the lane’s fair
And we keep choppas but niggas ain’t no saints here
Got so many bricks you would thought that nigga Frank’s here
We don’t do no snitchin cus that’ll get you shanked here
Compton California, Murderville be the place we at
We’re the wrong shit, find a pistol where yo face is at
4-5 on me, damn right I got my pistol packed
And if you scared to kill yourself or find whatever makes us that
I be where the races at, victory I’m facin that
Money just to blow and it’s plenty more replacing that
I’m so icy like I’m Gucci Mane1Embed
