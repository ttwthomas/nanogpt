88 ContributorsLoyal Lyrics
Young Mula, baby!
(Let me see)
Haha
You thought it was over?
(Let me see)

I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowin' up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, ooh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart when she'd rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch an inch when she'd rather have nine?
You know how the game goes, she be mine by halftime
I'm the shit, ooh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everythin' but trust these hoes (Let me see)
CB, fuck with me

When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothin' for ya
Oh, these hoes ain't loyal
Woah, these hoes ain't loyal
Yeah-yeah, let me see
See Chris Brown LiveGet tickets as low as $58,500You might also like
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches

Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the Bay with me
Eyes closed, smokin' marijuana
Rollin' up that Bob Marley, I'm a rasta
She wanna do drugs (Drugs)
Smoke weed, get drunk (Wasted)
She wanna see a nigga trap
She wanna fuck all the rappers (Let me see)

(Uh-huh)
When a rich nigga want you (Want you, baby)
And your nigga can't do nothin' for ya (Nothin', no)
Oh, these hoes ain't loyal (No, they ain't)
Woah, these hoes ain't loyal
Yeah-yeah, let me see

Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, let's get to it (Right away)
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know, girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
That's a no-no, girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance
Just got rich (Got rich)
Took a broke nigga bitch (Yeah)
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches (Girl, it's you)

(Uh-huh)
When a rich nigga want you (Yeah-yeah, want you, baby)
And your nigga can't do nothin' for ya (No, nothin', no-woah)
Oh, these hoes ain't loyal (Oh-oh-oh-oh-no)
Woah, these hoes ain't loyal
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, let me see

(Ha!) Rich young nigga
Name got bigger and my change got bigger, so my chains got bigger
Ferrari, Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out, "Money ain't a thing" (Ha!)
Ha, me and CB in the Bay with her (Bay with her)
I sent her back home so you can lay with her
Okay, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin'
All these karats like I'm a fuckin' vegetarian
Shout-out Weezy F., keep a redbone wet
Rose Rolex, hoes on deck, she know I got a check
Do it too good when she ride that dick (Woo)
Man, I wouldn't trust that bitch, no (Haha)
Come on, come on, girl, why you frontin'?
Baby, show me somethin'
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl, why you frontin'?
Baby, show me somethin'
You done spent your bread on her
And it's all for nothin' (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, let me see)

(Uh-huh)
When a rich nigga want you (Want you, baby, yeah, woo)
And your nigga can't do nothin' for ya (Can't do nothin' for you)
Oh, these hoes ain't loyal (Oh, no)
Woah, these hoes ain't loyal
Yeah-yeah, let me see (Woo)
(Uh-huh)
When a rich nigga want you (Want you, baby, yeah)
And your nigga can't do nothin' for ya (Oh-woah-oh)
