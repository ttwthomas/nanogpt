2 ContributorsLets Chill LyricsLets Chill....Like Zero Below
Had to introduce her to my hero below
Not a waste of time says my Frank Muller
And we could swim around
And just drown in the cooler
Baby we could chill like
Ice im the jeweler
Wrap around your ass like a bracelet or a hula...
Hoop!
The group...is Young Mula
But theres another subject
See right now im tryna budge into your situation, girl im like a mental patient
Lookin for an invitation
To your destination
Girl i like your presentation
And i like your dedication
I ain't talkin admiration
Girl im talking mezmoration!!You might also likeEmbed
