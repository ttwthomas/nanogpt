4 ContributorsDon’t Tell Me It’s Over (Remix) Lyrics
All press is good press kids
So if you wanna see us gone
Then I suggest you keep our name out of your headlines
Unless you wanna mess that is
Your best bet is to set your dirty laundry separate from the clean before your deadline
Admit it you wanted to be an artist
But your parents and that tiny voice inside you said it wasn't worth the hardships
What better way to compensate then to hate on everything you wish you were
But didn't have the balls to harness
Pop culture's my trip, somehow you think your gonna stop us
Cuz you flirted with a chick who's got my tongue in her esophagus
Bitches post anonymous
We shat on 07, 08 is gonna be great imagine 2011
Give me one good reason I shouldn't dead this debate
Don't worry I'll wait....
That's the fuck I thought
Cat got your tongue
Next time get your facts right
Google me and act right

How can I be with...
Be without your hate
It gives me peace of mind
So please don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
It's your hate that keeps me believing
That we're the greatest of all time
So please don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
You might also like
Don't tell me it's over
Because I can't bare to see you go
See you go
Don't tell me it's over
Because I can't bare to see you go
See you go

Hey Mr. Internet
To whom it may piss off, yea you and you
Here's a list of shit you didn't know but now you do
Exploit my bad habits
Tell them I do drugs
Tell them Travis smokes more crack than Tyrone Biggums does
Tell them I can't rap
Tell them I dumb it down
Tell them not to buy tickets whenever my band's in town
Tell them I sold out, say I did it for the fame
And how I buy magazines for the sake of seeing my name
Tell them I how frequent parties trying to get that page 6
Tell them so and so someone saw pictures of my dick
Make me out to be an asshole that don't deserve his fans
Make me more insecure than I already am
Kick dirt on my accomplishments if you're ever bored
Just document it well and don't forget to hit record
One hit wonder my ass, what are you talking about
Let them keep bogging trash im gonna take the garbage out

Say the fucking baby
Never been fake and they are clayer than Aiken
And I don't play though, and they love to hate it
And I love it, and I would hate to not be hated
Hate cuz I'm ahead so much so my drop be hating
License plate reads hating
Eat my dust
Just hate us
Hater, hater, hater I love you so much
