16 ContributorsNo Brainer Lyrics
Turn the music up

Uh, them hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don’t let it blow up in your face slime
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a motherfuckin' K9
We murk niggas in the day time when the birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'
Everybody got automatics like cockin' back is too time-consumin'
Bought my bitch her own business so she can stay the fuck out mine
But she know hoes, hoes ain’t nothin' but hoes, ain’t good for nothin' but a house fire
Got a .9 right by her panty line, she’ll blow you away like a dandelion
And before they cross me, they’ll nail me to it
And I'ma dance when it's hammer time
My insides fucked up, and it feels so good to be vandalized
And these bars is handlebars, 'cause when I spit, I handle mine
God made dirt and dirt don’t hurt, that’s a lie
Cause I come from that dirty-dirty, and I know pain like raps and rhymes, my nigga
Doing big things, big wings, dragonflies
If I don’t live to see tomorrow, all my kids got daddy's eyes

I hustle, hustle like the rent was due yesterday
Muscle car got more muscles than a heavyweight
Take these bitches breath away, resuscitate
And the weed I smoke is strong as pepper spray, that strong
Pussy walls I interior decorate
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
Put in over time, that’s why I get paid the big check
Tote a .45 'cause they ain’t make the .46 yet
You might also like
Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer
Fuck around and you can get shot up, like a low angle
Old ass money, I been ballin’ my nigga
And I been stop wearing Versace
'Cause I was wearing Versace when Pac was wearin' Versace

Uh, real niggas say, "Woo woo"
And such and such kill such and such
The streets talkin', bullshit walks on crutches but it strut the strut
Niggas panic, button pressin', the end is coming, count your blessings
We livin' in the day and time, where the Ten Commandments are now suggestions
How depressin', how unpleasant, click-clack, pow intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses with tight pussies, I found the crevice
High socks, and tie-dye shirts
My fashion statement is a run-on sentence
Pussy niggas still making me sick
Kill all them niggas, no more symptoms

I’m smokin' weed in my tool shack
I'm gettin' twisted like Allen wrenches
Bitch, come dance with the devil nigga like ballerinas in catechism
Got a AK with a shell-catcher
And I'll pistol whip ya 'til your head swell up
No Xanax, just coke and Henny
I had to kick that shit like 4/20
And I hit yo' ass with the SIG Sauer (Boom)
Had them put you back together like a jigsaw
And I'ma still bring that bacon home
I don't really give a fuck what the pigs thought
A pussy-ass rat, that's Tom and Jerry (Yeah)
I was gettin' fat off of commissary (Yeah)
And rest in peace to my nigga Soupy (Yeah)
I've been goin' in since Slime was buried (Suwoop)
And in jail, them snacks like bags of money
Just imagine what I had before a bag of cookies
A new deck of cards and a bag of coffee
Get you poked up dead in the shower, bloody
It's fucked up but it's safe to say
For the last seven months, I felt right at home (True)
And with the same pen that they stabbed you with
I'll wash that bitch off and go write a poem (Ugh)
Niggas sleepin' on me, had to shoot one time just to see who'd wake
I don't see your fate but I can see you fake
I gotta light my grass just to see you snakes
Bitch, life is a gamble
Pay up what you owe boy
No drive-bys like they did Ricky
I'm hoppin' out like Doe Boy
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Hustle like the rent was due yesterday
Muscle car got more muscles than a heavyweight
On the edge, just one step away so step away
And the weed I smoke is strong as pepper spray, that strong
Pussy walls I interior decorate
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
Put it over time, that’s why I get paid that big check
Tote a .45 'cause they ain’t make a .46 yet

Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
I got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
Blow your fuckin' brains out, that's a no brainer, hahaha8Embed
