I be on it all night, man I be on it (day day)

If you want me you can find me in da

HEY! (I'm on it)

Time and time again, punk
Ho I’m back to telling you
I’m the shit, bitch
That’s it, all I’m telling you
Do not interrupt my grind
Playboy I am telling you
Or I will visit you on Monday
By Friday they smellin’ you
I be burning kryp
It take  to your favorite boo
B’ you see me swinging drunk
Candy paint on twenty-twos
Ridin’ in the ‘llac with the weed in the back
With the crack in the Mac and the pack in the back
Cause the Krypt on the wood
And the cruise on chrome
Fuck me, I was getting my Twista on
Fuck that, let me get my Twista on
I’mma burn me a zip
With a hydro grip
I buy by the pound, baby
Not by the zip
I take it outta town in the trunk of a rental
To the hotel with the pounds get flipped
If you need them grams, I’m your man
Blueberry, Amsterdam
Northern Lights; You understand?
See Killer Mike LiveGet tickets as low as $33You might also like

Straight up on dat Kryptonite

Straight up on dat Kryptonite

Time and time again I gotta tell these niggas and these hoes
I am Weezy, baby, president and CEO
I be on that bubble gum
Straight from my  candy store
Fifi roll a cherry blunt
Call that thing a 
Know what’s in my tall cup
Watch me drink it all up
Yeah, that’s that syrup baby
Get yo’ Paul Wall up
Steppin’ out the Maserati
Totin’ that Kamikaze
Smokin’ that morning mist
Smellin’ like Bath and Body
What about that peach and cream
What about banana split
What about that kiwi dream
We be on that fruity shit
I like that straight kush
I like that straight piff
I need a wheelchair
Cause I be on that Krypt


Time and time again I gotta turn back ‘round every other way
Cause Bubba matters by  let me ventilate
Let me breathe
96 degrees and I chillin’ these
Suckas try to hit me with the freeze
Heat it back up, mail it in with ease
Pick up the pace
Whip dick in your face
Big winnin’ the race
And this his ace
Any of these fakes
Trynna enter this space
Pray to God for his grace
This Krypt is night laced
Get you a taste
Stutterin’ with Bubba
Get it with Killer
Leave with Concrete
Smerk with the perc
Murders a cur
Up this syrup
I’’ll certainly show ya
You’ve heard it before
You’ll see it again
It’s me at the beginning
It’ll be me at the end
Much to a sucka emcees chagrine
That Kryptonite finna win
