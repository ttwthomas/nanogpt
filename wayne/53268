26 ContributorsCan You Believe It Lyrics
Can you believe it
Believe that

Young Stunna, Young Stunna
The way that paint dripping it's gon' be a bloody summer
Twenty-two inches, all-red everything
That's Soo Woo business, holla at your five
Four, three, two, one, bitch in the cockpit
And my knot's sick, I'm ill
I've got a milli in my Louis
Red Cardinal fitted, bitches feel me in the Louis, yeah
Red rubies in my watch and my chain
Catch me in Wade County, I'm the king like James
Headed to the game, red Challenger today
Throwing the red flags like I'm challenging the play
Tune, this shit retarded
I need a red helmet
And I'm all about my cake, red velvet
You can't help it, gotta see what I got
It's like Ripley's: Believe it or Not, you tell me

Can you believe it
Believe that
See The Game LiveGet tickets as low as $163You might also like
I'm a beast, believe that
Stop playing, I go hard, I go He Man
Young Tune,break em off like a tree branch
Play with me you in hot water: tea bag
All-black Maybach, call it decaf
And I just ordered your girlfriend some kneepads
Can you believe the unbelievable
Bitch, I'm higher than Venus, Serena too
Yeah Game, holla at you Soo Woo
Young Money bitch, we cold like two scoops
Life's a bitch and mine a diva
Point the biggest skeptic out I make them a believer

Can you believe it
Believe that

Yeah believe that, 100 on the marble floor
And everyday we on the grind
Try and flip some more
Yeah understand, acres on that new lane
Suicide doors, niggas on that new lane
Yeah pussy popping bullshit
Bullshit ain't shit, nigga we the shit
We the business, Louie on every trip
Holiday everyday on the YM ship
Yeah, cause every day my sun shine
Candy paint on the car, making headlines
Believe that, we good with that cake homie
Believe that, we ride every day homie
Can you believe it
Believe that4Embed
