13 ContributorsBlood Niggaz Lyrics
Fresh out the Pyrex spot, red Chucks on
Red beam on the Glock, so you better get your duck on
Blood in, Blood out, that's how I get my thug on
No smile on my face, that's how I get my mug on
Keep that 40 cal on my waist, I get my slug on
Eastside fools gang, that's how I get my Blood on
Blood know what it is when I got my red cap on
Not from the Nolia but everybody get they clap on
Sippin', sittin' sat, red Kool-Aid pack
The big homie Dub just came home, 'bout to get it crackin'
Yeah, don't mix gang-bangin' with this rap shit
My niggas bananas, red bandanas when they clap shit
Red rags around they face in traffic
Lookin' like George Bush never found Bin Laden
Rick James used to let me drive his lowrider
Bloods in Miami and I ain't talkin' bout Flo Rida

Got my nigga Streets in here with me
Bloods down south, guns in your mouth
Eat these fuckin' bullets, and shit them bitches out
I'm talkin' Blood nigga shit, Menace what it do?
I keep a red bitch, I call her Damu
I'm sayin' "soowoo" to the hive
You know what I'm bangin' bout
Pistol in my sock, if I run I'll blow a ankle out
I body these beats, body bag in the booth
Red flag around the rear view mirror in the coupe
Oops, I meant the boupe
I'm smokin' on the sloop
And they know my group, more bloods than the loop
Blood I'm too high, I'mma have to stoop
And if you think you fly, I'mma shoot your parachute
Hat to the right, flag to the same side
Weezy F Baby and the F is for flames, five
No homo, big B's nigga
Blood game homie, bleed nigga

That's why we decked in all green because we LPBs
Down here in Salty D where Damus roam free
The capital for soo-woopin's the planet of southeast
And this ain't no offshoot city we been in since the 70's
And since I've been around ain't shit about protected communities
I wanted to be down the homies sent me on shootin' sprees
Now where I'm from if you ain't did that you ain't no Blood
Just like if you ain't washed no niggas you ain't no judge
He say "soowoo" in his raps that don't mean shit
You didn't do nothin' when your homie got lit up by them Crips
And the main thing that show that y'all ain't no Blood
Is when you come to San Diego y'all don't hit me up
This is not rap shit, Mitchy's really been active
Blood niggas from bross bountry make sure they get at him
Legendary in the cherry spur with Spalding guts
Yeah, I still got on Dickies, I won't change
Now I'm just a ballin' Blood1Embed
