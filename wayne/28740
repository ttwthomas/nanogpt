1 ContributorPretty Brown Lyrics
Uh, Slick-dickie on my one and two
So sweet what I did with a Honey-Doo
No pun intended, no one offended
You just bet' not leave yo' girlfriend unattended
I holla at her, holla but don't scream
I ask her "Why sleep if we don't dream?
So let's stay awake, besides, dreams are fake"
She say "Ooh you deep?" I ask "How deep can you take?"
Hehe, my loveboat in ya lake
Baby can I stick my lovenote in ya gate
Hehe, read and weep
Sincerely fuckin' yours, Weezy F B

It's that pretty down round, drvin' me wild
Cause baby I'm lovin' your style, and the way that you do
The things that you do, when you do what your doing
We can do it, anyway you like if you know what I mean
Thinking you might wanna play on my team
The way that you do, the things that you do when you do what your doing
We can do it, so keep going girl, keep going girl
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Cause I'm on it girl, and I wanna take you
To the top, the top, the top, the top
Straight to the top, to the top...
You might also like
I prefer that you would just call me
Weezy, Eastside gangsta
And, I be runnin' this shit like the Flanker
Blackcard Banker, hanker in the backpocket
And I wear them skinny jeans, so you see my fat wallet
That's right I'm a big shot, call me " Little Cannon Ball
Mr. "Get up in your girl mouth", like some Ambersol
Hip-hop president, ain't my girl elequant
Don't she got more junk in her trunk then an elephant
Nigga I'm an animal, watch me, I examine you
And my chucks are old, but I swear to you my flanel new
I get money manual, then I just man you
Bitch ass nigga, I'm gone like my Lam' roof, Young Money!

It's that pretty down round, drvin' me wild
Cause baby I'm lovin' your style, and the way that you do
The things that you do, when you do what your doing
We can do it, anyway you like if you know what I mean
Thinking you might wanna play on my team
The way that you do, the things that you do when you do what your doing
We can do it, so keep going girl, keep going girl
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Cause I'm on it girl, and I wanna take you
To the top, the top, the top, the top
Straight to the top, to the top...1Embed
