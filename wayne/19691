7 ContributorsAin’t Sayin’ Nothing Lyrics
Cool & Dre
(This)
Black game
(Is)
Terror Squad (I, I, I, I, I)
The remix

Gotta say my name
Weezy F. Baby
(This is) Weezy F. Baby
Aka it's the remix baby
Now let me get into it
And do it how I do it
Yeah, long hair don't care like the jewish
Garbage man
I'll be dumpin
And I eat beef but the cow eat nuthin
You probably say I didn't when I did
Or I wasn't when I was
And I'm not when I'm is
You and yo homies wack
You probably had too much of that corny yack
So watch where ya goin
And know where you at
Cause me and my goonz don't know you like that
Never been a sucka
Metal in the duffle
I'm all about my chips
I gets my ruffles
Joey I got ya
B boy bluffing
I'm doin the Hulk Hogan but they ain't sayin nuthin
You might also like
You ain't sayin nuthin
I be spendin euros by the pound I'm talkin London
If it ain't about some millions boy you ain't sayin nuthin, you ain't sayin nuthin
Actin like you tough, when it go down you go to runnin
Boy you ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't about money, money)
You ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
You ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
You ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)

Ayo macho, check it
(You ain't sayin nuthin) (If it ain't bout money, money)
I gotta pocket full of benjamins and I'm so cold
My neck froze like a penguin, somewhere in England
Waitin for my little duffle bag girl to land, with duffle bag in hand
It's louis vuitton and
She flyer than a eagle
Hood like a regal
She make my deposit, my closet is fresh segal
I rain terror, yes I rain terror
Put my name on ya mind my style is New Era
I been down in miami, sippin ballets with Khaled
I gotta secret to tell that boy ain't from Cali
He from mars
Flow sicker than sars
Tore into his cars
My dunk sittin bigger than yours
I got, big gunz, real big gunz
Spit like a dominican I call dat shit Big Pun
And any nigga that's a enemy to crack is a enemy to me
Terror Squad and the P

We on that B.S. but you can call it T.S
Cause we be iced the fuck out, when you see us (yeah)
We on that B.S. but you can call it ts (This is the g-mix)
Cause we be iced the fuck out, when you see us (coca, ouhooooo, crack)
Uh oh uh oh oh oh joey
This nigga got ya for his chain but you told me
He was phony but we didn't wanna listen
Knowing all alone that this nigga was a victim
They ain't sayin nuthin
Let me tell you somethin
Terror squad we be that fuckin clique that you can trust in
You heard game his enemy's my enemy
Young buck callin me he wanna be a friend of me
My hearts empty (empty)
So don't tempt me (Tempt me)
That red dot on the Glock will blow ya memory (whaaaa)
You got money we got money who cares
Now where you guys at I been lookin everywhere


You ain't sayin nuthinEmbed
