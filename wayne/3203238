4 ContributorsWe Like The Cars Lyrics
Bingo
Ain’t that that motherfucker right there
Yea yea look at that shit
Oooo shit look at the motherfucking wheels
Yo yea that’s it right there
Damn nigga those rims tight like a motherfucker
Hey give me a slim jim
Hurry up motherfucker lets get the fuck out
Don’t be trippin’ I’ll be outside y’all niggas hurry up
Kane get me the motherfuckin radio
Hey man you watching out
Nigga hurry the fuck up
Nigga I know what the fuck I’m doing, you just watch out
Nigga you… c’mon man!
You got it? You got it?!
Yea
Damn man c’mon get in
Damn
Where the screwdriver
No no the screwdriver
Uhh

We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom
You might also like
Uhh, 1 2, Writer, Dipset writers block nigga
I’m back, but I ain’t by myself
I brought a few friends along
Pulled up in something nice too
220 on the dash by the way

We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom
We like the cars, we-we-we like the cars
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom

Uhh, I get cheese, whip sprees, big D’s
But it ain’t Bentley, it’s a Bugatti, with a parle
On my off day, it’s a ducatti
I don’t move sloppy, I’m a known goon
And my trunk ain’t the only thing that go boom
Get a pro room
This is big cash, my whip so fast, I get whiplash
When I skid past, with the rip rags
So much rides I got my own six flags, damn!
You want sick I can tell boy
But my doors lift like they on steroids
When I ever get to rode through the peas
They be jealous as a hoe cus I bees
No top exposed in the V (matter the fact)
Tell Jerry Springer to throw me some beads
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom
We like the cars, we-we-we like the cars
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom

Yea, uh um, call me two-seat Tune
No speakers but I keep that boom
Tell the car salesman I’ll be back soon
Bought a truck for the night and a drop for the noon
Pull up at the light pull the top back smooth
Push one button and everything moves
Push my button and everyone shoot
And I got one word for the cops, vroom
J.R and BMJR
Only like weed and bitches in they car
Television screen and systems in they car
And my whip posed topless like for playboy haha
I ridin’ down your family street
Knock your portrait off your mantle piece
Ha I’m probably listening to Coldplay or that old Jay ya

We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom
We like the cars, we-we-we like the cars
We-we-we like the cars, the cars that go boom-boom2Embed
