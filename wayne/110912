3 ContributorsNight & Day Lyrics
I know them other dudes try, but you know I will
Put that thing on ya, I’mma have you falling in love, yeahhh
And shawty love it how the homeboy grip that wheel
But I should warn ya, I’mma have you fallin in love, yeahhh
And girl I know you like it when I turn that beat down real low
You hear them 808′s hummin’
I got it chopped and screwed, so it’s moving real slow
That’s how you know that I’m comin’
Aww baby
I told her I can show you how I feel about you night and day
That’s how I feel about you, and baby you can call me
And you can call me up, and I’ll come runnin’ to you right away
That’s how I feel about you
Shawty, I got a fly spot where we can chill
If ya wanna call me when ya leavin’ the club, yeahhh
Tell ya homegirl you about to get your thrills
Call her back when ya boy finish beatin’ it up, yeahhh
Cause girl I know you like it when I turn that beat down real low
You hear them 808′s hummin’
I got it chopped and screwed, so it’s moving real slow
That’s how you know that I’m comin’
Hey, I wanna show you
I told her I can show you how I feel about you night and day
That’s how I feel about you, that’s how I feel about you baby
And you can call me up, and I’ll come runnin’ to you right away
That’s how I feel about you, night and day
Best of both worlds
Holla at ya boy, it’s Weezy F the most girls
Haha, okay Lloyd we crack
We make her fall in love, boy you make her fall back
Boy I make her call back and when she do I answer:
“Hello, how you doing? Let’s hook up?”
And when we do, we do it several times like she mines
Kisses where she wishes, I Grant it like Ulysses, haha
King of the late night, everything ’bout me trill
Baby I’m from Texas, gripping this wood wheel
You looking like you lost, let me navigate up inside ya
Face in the pillow, I’m tryna hide ya on some other shit
Somewhere on the sideline watching, that’s where the mother sit
All between your legs, face diving, that’s where the mother spit
How these niggas tryna recruit ya? Their game is way off
You first drink on the team that’s in the playoffs, chyea
I told her I can show you how I feel about you night and day
That’s how I feel about you, oh yeahhh
And you can call me up, and I’ll come runnin’ to you right away
That’s how I feel about you, that’s how I feelYou might also like1Embed
