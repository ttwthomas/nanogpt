16 ContributorsRidin’ With the AK Lyrics
I—I—I—I—I be on it, on it all night—man, I be on it all day
Straight up, boy, if you want me (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
I be riding with that K, K (Yuh), K, K (Huh)
K, K, K (Spitta), K (Yuh)

Time and time again, I gotta grab my phone and call Lil Wayne:
"Let me use your throwaway, 'cause niggas out here playin', man"
They just don't get it 'til I pop the trunk and come back with it
Barrel on the burner big enough to spit a hundred midgets
I'm from the Crescent City, moving nothing less than fifty
That's more shells than you'll find in the seat
And you don't need to know your alphabets to recognize a G
I'm in the Lambo', making doughnuts, like I work for Krispy Kreme, ha
Excuse my flossin', dog—I'm still known to tote a snub
Niggas thought I lost all my blickas in that Katrina flood
I still got big, U—MAC-11 from '97
Sometimes, you gotta show niggas better than you can tell 'em

I—I—I—I be on that gangster shit, straight up on that gangster shit
I be on that, straight up on that, I be on that gangster shit
I be on that, straight up on that, I be on that gangster shit
I be on that, straight up on that, I be on that gangster shit

I—I—I—I be on it, on it all night—man, I be on it all day
Straight up, boy, if you want me, I be riding with that—
K (Who want it?), K (Who want it?), K (Who want it?), K (Ugh)
K (Who want it?), K (Who want it?), K (Who want it?), K

I'm on that gangster shit, I'm on that gangster shit
I'm on that gangster shit, I'm on that gangster shit, chyeah (Uh-uh)

Chevys riding, swerving out, mufflers stuffed with 'dro and blow
Mack Maine, Young Money—motto still "Fuck a ho"
Burners on the front seat, 'case a hater come that close
Body drop when the shotty pop, it'll prolly make your body rock

Body rock—yup! Nigga, lean with it, rock with it
Thing'll make you lean—I be seen round the clock with it
See, I don't stop with it—hustle for that new money
Smelling like them new hundreds; diarrhea, loot runnin'
See, I just recruit something that help me move it every day
More workers than Mary Kay; vibing to that Mary J
I'm off the chain, like free slaves; bitch, I'm 'bout my chips
I'm Mack Maine, bitch! I'm on that gangster shit
I—I—I be on that gangster shit, straight up on that gangster shit
I be on that, straight up on that, I be on that gangster shit (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
I be on that, straight up on that, I be on that gangster shit
I be on that, straight up on that, I be on that gangster shit

I—I—I—I be on it, on it all night—man, I be on it all day
Straight up, boy, if you want me, I be riding with that—
K (Who want it?) K (Who want it?), K (Who want it?), K (Ugh)
K (Who want it?), K (Who want it?) K (Who want it?) K (Ugh)

I'm on that gangsta shit, I'm on that gangsta shit
I'm on that gangsta shit, I'm on that gangsta shit, chyeah (Gangsta Grillz, you bastards! Gangsta—)

Time and time again, I gotta turn around and tell Fee Dawg:
"Grab that AK off my backseat—it's gon' be blood all on them, dog"
Clip longer than a bitch; if a nigga trip, pop it on in, and give a nigga that shit
Pull it right over and park that whip—everybody better run when the trunk door lift
Shit, the only thing I'm runnin from: myself, with a gun 'til them fuckboys come
The nigga that talk ain't talking 'bout nothing; I'm a rudeboy—I murder for fun
I'm hot, bitch—word to the Sun; I'm the Birdman's son, I'm the chosen one
I'm the god, just looking for a nun; I'm the president: My job here is done (Ugh)
Chevys riding, swerving out, mufflers stuffed with 'dro and blow
Cash Money, Young Money—motto still "Fuck a ho"
Burners on the front seat, 'case a hater come that close
Body drop when the shotty pop, it'll prolly make your body rock

Lean with it (Rock with it)
Lean with it (Rock with it)
Lean with it (Rock with it)
Snap your fingers, nigga
I make you lean with it (Rock with it)
Make you lean with it (Rock with it)
Nigga, lean with it (Rock with it)
Now, bring the hook in and tell 'em 'bout it

I—I—I—I be on it, on it all night—man, I be on it all day
Straight up, boy, if you want me, I be riding with that—
K (Who want it?) K (Who want it?), K (Who want it?), K (Ugh)
K (Who want it?), K (Who want it?), K (Who want it?), K

I'm on that gangster shit, I'm on that gangster shit
I'm on that gangster shit, I'm on that gangster shit (Gangsta GriZillz)

We 'bout to stop 'em in they tracks
And show 'em that we root
Let's—boom! get shot
We 'bout to stop 'em in they tracks
And it keep my motherfucking name
Boom! Get shot, bitch!4Embed
