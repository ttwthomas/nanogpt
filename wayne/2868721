You got the light, count it all joy
You got the right to be mad
But when you carry it alone you find it only getting in the way
They say you gotta let it go

Now tell 'em why you mad son
Cause doing it all ain't enough
'Cause everyone all in my cup
'Cause such and such still owe me bucks
So I got the right to get bucked
But I try not to let it build up
I'm too high, I'm too better, too much
So I let it go, let it go, let it go

I ran into this girl, she said, "Why you always blaming?"
"Why you can't just face it?" (Be mad, be mad, be mad)
"Why you always gotta be so mad?" (Be mad, be mad, be mad)
"Why you always talking shit, always be complaining?"
"Why you always gotta be, why you always gotta be so..." (Be mad, be mad, be mad)
I got a lot to be mad about (Be mad, be mad, be mad)

Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love, baby?

Yeah, but I got a lot to be mad about
Got a lot to be a man about, got a lot to pop a xan about
I used to rock hand-me-downs and now I rock standing crowds
But it's hard when you only got fans around and no fam around
And if they are, then their hands is out and they pointing fingers
When I wear this fucking burden on my back
Like a motherfucking cap and gown
Then I walk up in the bank, pants sagging down
And I laugh at frowns—what they mad about?
'Cause here come this motherfucker with this mass account
That didn't wear a cap and gown
Are you mad 'cause the judge ain't give me more time?
And when I attempted suicide, I didn't die
I remember how mad I was on that day
Man, you gotta let it go before it get up in the way
Let it go, let it go

I ran into this girl, she said, "Why you always blaming?"
"Why you can't just face it?"
"Why you always gotta be so mad?" (Be mad, be mad, be mad)
I got a lot to be mad about (Be mad, be mad, be mad)

Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love go?
Where'd your love, baby?
I ran into this girl, I said, "I'm tired of explaining"
Man, this shit is draining
But I'm not really allowed to be mad28Embed
