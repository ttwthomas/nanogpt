60 ContributorsIma Boss (Remix) Lyrics
Remix!
(One two, one two)
This the I'ma Boss Remix
Meek Milly
Let's go!

I'm ride or die as I'm ridin' by, holla Westside right inside of my
Bimmer 760i, try me let off sixty shots
Again we got the city hot and popping like it ‘posed to be
Hoes who not ménaging got no business standing close to me
So cold, a ferocious G, niggas ain't as dope as me
Mind your fuckin' business, watch your mouth when you approachin' me
I fuck with hoes who fuck with hoes, do pills and powder socially
I like 'em, I don't love ‘em though, cold heart emotionally
Captain where the ocean is, riding in the Ghost again
Slap you with a lot of spit until she swallow all of it
Call the shots, run the shit, on some big money shit
Serious 'bout my hustle all these cowards on that funny shit
Rapping 'bout a bunch of shit and you ain't even done it yet
You the one they gunning at, how I'm ‘posed to honor that?
You all talk dawg, flaw and I ain't having none of that
I'm big boss dawg, floss all day and run it back

Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We in this bitch, it’s going down
Yeah, I'm the king, now where my muhfucking crown?
You might also like
You a boss, she a boss, you don't care what it cost
You just buy that motherfucker and you throw that shit on
You be popping them tags, we just throw it in bags
And then we hit the fucking block, we be droppin' them rags

Started with a dollar, turn it to a M
Used to ride Impala, turn it to a Benz
Niggas used to hate me, turn into my friends
You should see how people treat you when that money coming in
Bad bitches calling cause I'm balling
And these niggas hatin' on me cause they starving
And I'm parking Aston Martins where they walking, these niggas ain't important
They informants really talking when the people get to honking
I'm a boss, really, Nino or Al Pacino
Hundred racks on this Rollie, it light up like a casino
Niggas really be fraud, I’ma keep it a C-note
Got shooters down in Miami, they throw it like Dan Marino

Had a couple seizures, call 'em minor setbacks
Everybody praying for me, I respect that
Woke up in the hospital, where my checks at
Then I put eight chains, where my neck's at
Hopping in the Ghost, I feel I'm dead set
Worth 40 M's so respect that
I put all my jewels on just to bone your chick
You know the boss well known for leavin' bonuses
We making money, may it marinate
When the work clean, cut it like it’s carrot cake
D-boys love the way I narrate
I still whip it like it's Anna Mae
Remember Momma had a Cavalier
Now she living like a Cleveland Cavalier
Better check the stats, we fillin' arenas
And I got the gats, Gilbert Arenas
Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We in this bitch, it’s going down
Yeah, I'm the king, now where my muhfucking crown?

You a boss, you a boss
7-5-7, showers on it
Spend about thirteen hours on it
757 with the showers on it
We spent about thirteen hours on it

Look, I be probably on my skateboard, tryna learn a new trick
I just fucked an Avatar, now I got a blue dick
Money talks, bullshit walks if the shoe fit
You pushing up daisies, daffodils, tulips
I'm in my zone, I'm Angie Stoned
I point the pistol at you like a camera phone
I'm Young Money, Cash Money, I'm not human
I’m tryna get money, money like Mark Cuban
If she don't respect me, she gon' respect this dick
The world is an asshole and we the next big shit
Damn right I gang bang, tell 'em blood up slime
Fuck! I had to say fuck one time, get it
When I came up in this bitch I was shining every summer
Took the whole thing, the young nigga doing numbers
Tote two nines, bitch, iced out stunting
Candy on the Ave, candy on the slab
Hundred Gs nigga, Cash Money millionaires
Hundred mil nigga, how we flipped it off the ave
Blood rich gang, you know we filthy nigga
The money do swang, behind a killer nigga
Catch me uptown putting it down
Moving all around, new fleets with my round
Touch another town, putting it all down
Pop a hundred bottles bitch, we wear the crown

Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We in this bitch, it’s going down
Yeah, I'm the king, now where my muhfucking crown?

You a boss, you a boss
7-5-7 showers on it
Spend about thirteen hours on it
757 with the showers on it
We spent about thirteen hours on it12Embed
