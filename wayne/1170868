And I'm with my nigga Boo, and he going I'm with my man Spitta, and he gon' holla at one of his homies or something on they bus. And I ain't feelin the music that he playing, know what I mean. I ain't gon' go on the mans bus and be like, man this is whack. Imma be like fuck, alright, bob my fucking head stomp my feet. When I get off that bus Imma tell Spitta "boy this here was the wackest shit I ever heard." I'm gon' respect my situation man, respect something that's higher than me, man.
