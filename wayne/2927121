1 ContributorI Made It Cover LyricsI look up to the sky
And now the World is mine
Ive known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life Im living now
I know that theres no doubt
I made it, I made it!

Coming out the spot like the next phenomenon
I'm going to be a rap don
You can hate me or love me, I don’t mind
To me it’s fine because I’m spitting rhymes
I'm the next meanest up and running rapper in the game
Look at all you lame artists sitting back in shame
I could have made hit tracks, from the start
But then there's no improvement, you know
And the shit I do again and again will be boring in the end
I look up to the sky
And now the World is mine
Ive known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life Im living now
I know that theres no doubt
I made it, I made it!

Maybe I went down the wrong way
Maybe I should have became a singer, let’s just say
My fear is losing my loved ones forever
Never, I'm working hard to make them happy forever
I focus on my dreams and goals
Music, school and family
Only thing on my mind, constantly
Taking my music seriously
I'm making songs at 17
My music and I, you know nothings in between
I promise to become better
Reality Check was my first shot
So, I showed nothing toward what I got
You have to believe in me
Cause I have something to show the world in front of me
I don't know what floor you’re on because I can see?
I look up to the sky
And now the World is mine
Ive known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life Im living now
I know that theres no doubt
I made it, I made it!
 Sing
See, I don't care for glamour
And I don't care for name
I'm in it for the love of the fans
Music is my only reason
I'm living, isn't that what everyone’s thinking?
I live life routine based
Hate how everything changes
Everyone's still waiting for me
Sitting patient in fear, so I’m ready to appearEmbed
