20 ContributorsDeep End Lyrics
Look what you done done, yeah
Play with my heart and told me it's too bad
And then you hit me up
I'm tryna talk, you told me hit you back
It's crazy how you drive me brazy
I think I finally met my match
I try to let my mind navigate me
And end up bringing me right back

I've been falling in the deep end
You've been giving me no reason
But I've been drowning in and sinking
Falling in the deep end
I've been falling in the deep end
You've been looking for a reason
But I've been crawling in and reaching, ooh
Falling in the deep end, deep end, deep end
Falling in the deep end, deep end, deep end
Falling in the deep end, deep еnd
Falling in the deep end
Falling in the deep еnd

You tell me I'm wrong
'Cause when I'm right it only makes you mad
But you want what you want
But how come I always want you bad?
It's brazy how you drive me crazy
I think I finally met my match
I know that this ain't how my mama raised me
But I done got too attached
You might also like
I've been falling in the deep end
You've been giving me no reason
But I've been drowning in and sinking
Falling in the deep end
I've been falling in the deep end
You've been looking for a reason
To dive in all up in the deep end
Falling in the deep end, deep end, deep end
Falling in the deep end, deep end, deep end
Falling in the deep end, deep end
Falling in the deep end

Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling in the deep end
It's crazy how she drive me brazy
I think I finally met my match
You saying you don't want to see me
And then you keep looking bad

I've been falling in the deep end
You've been giving me no reason
But I've been drowning in and sinking
Falling in the deep end2Embed
