DJ Drama for life
A Tribe Called Weezy
DJ Drama, fuck these niggas up

I'm a live my life, have my fun, act like I don't give a fuck
Live my life, have my fun, smoke like I don't give a fuck
Live my life, have my fun, fuck that shit, you only get one
Fuck that shit, I gotta sip some
I gotta bitch leaving, I gotta bitch coming (Aye)
I'm getting more pop on my skateboard
Niggas don't want me to pop like a bungee cord
I got my redbone head gone
That Bugatti go skirt like the legs showing
You think you street? I'm a jaywalker
I'm a basket case, where the fucking lawyer?
Yeah, Tunechi Li in this motherfucker
Niggas fuck with me in this motherfucker
I'ma smoke 'em until I get lung trouble
And these... niggas saying they the truth
But your pants on fire
Like I was born in the pool
I came up from the bottom
I'm a live my life, have my fun, skate like I don't give a fuck
Keep a brand new bitch, bout to get her ribbon cut
Rich, but I ain't rich enough
Your bitch is down, you bitchin up
Rolls Royce, topless, it's about to get titty fucked
You might also like
Okay, live my life, have no fun, 'less you give my niggas some
Live my life, what the fuck, can't recall me giving one
Live my life, have my fun, fuck like I don't give a fuck
And question, who the realest niggas?
Okay, that's a given one
Well welcome to the murder show
Show starts when the curtains close
Pass the scalpel to me, on my open-hearted surgeon flow
Why are all these coppers trippin?
Bitches down there, searching clothes
Yeah, I'm drinking stupid
What the fuck you think I'm swerving for?
Look, I be with that nigga from New Orleans
Who be asking if you heard me, even though he wasn't talking
Seen a straight chick do some dyke shit and didn't pause
And she was probably brokenhearted
I'm so gone, I probably caused it
I'm just saying
They ain't fucking with me
Bet they talking bout murdering me
But, look, Tune, I just don't see the killer in these niggas
2Pac's hologram was realer than these niggas

I'm a get this money, live my life and ball like I don't give a fuck
Get this money, live my life and ball like I don't give a fuck
Get this money, live my life and ball like I don't give a fuck
Rudy Gays up on the coupe, and Black Mambas on the Truck
I'm a dream chaser for stacking cheddar
I'm in my Olympic Dream Team's Retros Number 7s
What you know about getting money?
Hop out the coupe, I got your bitch in there, I leave the engine running
I hit the block, talk shit, roll a few stogies
Pop a bar, kill a lil' time on my Rollie
David Copperfield, I make a hundred disappear
Like I know magic, but ball like Jordan
Nigga hating on my new deal, James Harden
I guess cause I'm the shit, and you lil' niggas fartin'
With the weed, I did coke numbers, real talk
A buck fifty every three months, real talk
W-T-F, what the fuck nigga?
Tell them fuck niggas get the fuck nigga
Now who the fuck is with the fuck nigga?
It's just us, it's just us nigga
We the fuss nigga
That's a plus nigga
And we don't fuck with snitches trying to bust niggas
So tell them fuck niggas get the fuck nigga
I'm a live my life, have my fun, skate like I don't give a fuck
Live my life, have my fun, act like I don't give a fuck
Get this money, live my life, and ball like I don't give a fuck
Smoke weed with the windows up
High as fuck, but inching up
Pussy niggas tensing up
Are these niggas men or what?
I got your bitch antennas up
Money talks, your minutes up
You can judge us, but don't sentence us
Blow me like the wind would gust
We trukfit and we supered up
W-T-F, who to fuck?

And this, bitch I'm rolling with is cute
And her ass on fire
And the whole time, I ain't feel a tooth
Then I ate that pussy 'til I lost a diamond and I'm gone...15Embed
