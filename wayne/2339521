17 ContributorsDo Ya Thang (Remix) Lyrics
I fuck these hoes
Right after our show
Big dick, I slang
Freak bitch, do your thang, do your thang

Bust it open for them dollars
Stupid faded off that Henny, turning up with all your partners
I can tell that you been stressin', lost your job
Kicked out of school but I can tell you still a blessing
Ain't gon' lie this picture perfect
I ain't tryna be your man, but my attention you deserve it
Lotta bottles, lotta bitches can have any girl I want, but I just hope that we can kick it
They got it wet, kissin' on my neck, her homegirls upset
She tryna leave, not with them, with me
She drunk, gave her the keys
We got some weed, we smoking trees
Imma put that dick right where it supposed to be

I fuck these hoes
Right after our show
Big dick, I slang
Freak bitch, do your thang, do your thang
Big flexing, Rolls, jets
Rolex, more sex
Television, headrest
Rich bitch, do your thang
You might also like
Gucci on my shoes, Versace on my shirt
Eating ribs in first class, nosey bitch I work
I got tints on my Benz, curtains on my truck
You ain't got no business lookin all in here
Let your baby mama go let that bitch do it
You don't want no problems nigga we gon' get in to it
This is Young Juvie nigga, uncle Mannie Fresh
We got Tunechi on the remix, hallelujah blessing

I fuck these hoes
Right after our show
Big dick, I slang
Freak bitch, do your thang, do your thang
Big flexing, Rolls, jets
Rolex, more sex
Television, headrest
Rich bitch, do your thang

I don't got papers on that Glock
But I got papers on that mac
I don't got papers on that Glock
But I got papers on that mac
Duct tape 'round the handle, serial number get scratched
Potato on the barrel but y'all the ones that get mashed
Yeah
I turned my mansion into a juug house
I did tv show with Jessie off of Full House
Oh lord, I turned my mansion to a hoe house
My next show at home, I'm letting Soulja Slim close out
I rolls out in the coupe with the doors out, the hoes out
My flow is like a shoe with the soles out
Doctor Scholls vouch
I knows how move to with my nose down
Keep my nose out of people business news and these hoes mouth
Cause these hoes fowl
My poppa from the booth
I'm from Eagle Street, Hollygrove child
Used to have the Nissan with Bose sound
I drove around chrome .44 with the gold snout
Take your crown, extended clip that poke out
Reload rounds, sex with a bitch
Deep stroke ouch, I'm so aroused
Next to the bitch is a coke pile, your hoes mouth
Mine goes down, swallows child with no chow
That mean no teeth, holy cow
And I ain't climbing down
I never been a fan of common ground
I've been getting green since Bobby Brown
Been meaning to write my wrongs
But I've been too busy to jot 'em down
And when you visit I'm not around
I hope your view isn't from out of bounds
I come to do business
And for you new niggas disguising frowns
A Tunechi verse is like a body found
Remix, bitch1Embed
