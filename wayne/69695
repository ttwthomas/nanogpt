6 ContributorsLover (Not Full) LyricsI got that Gin in my system
Somebody gon' be my victim
Yea, don't fight that love
Just bare with me baby like a white and black cub
Girl, love is a must, so don't put up a fuss
I'm hard as steel she wet make it rust
What you know about it? And I'm so about it
Girl, this thing in my pants deserve a bow around it
All we do is fuss and fuck, don't start, honey
I put that dick into you good and make you walk funny
PJ he's young money, New Orleans in this bitch, don't start nothing
Won't be nothing, let me see something
I'm a lover, not a fighter, but I beat that pussy up, TunechiSee PJ Morton LiveGet tickets as low as $37You might also likeEmbed
