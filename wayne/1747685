1 ContributorWatch Them People LyricsIt was the summer of 2001
And I saw the whole fuckin thing
Yo! Can I say fuck on tv?
These guys had on some squad, shit!
It was Lil' Wayne, two puppies, one child, and a dike
But not just any dike, Dick Van Dike
Hey, can I give a few shotouts to my people?
Yo mom! Yo dad! What's up? Cool! I'm on tv!
Hey, I been tellin them guys to get off the corner!
