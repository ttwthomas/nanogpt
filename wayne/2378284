46 ContributorsThe Hills Lyrics
Your man on the low talkin' to po-po
I just poured a 4, I'm moving slow-mo
You just tryna get me out my Polo
The sex look even better on the Go-Pro
I already know you go commando
You ridin' me, my Magnum is your saddle
Find out I was cummin' and you swallow
And let me stick my thumb up in your asshole

We still get them chickens for the low low
Pistols got us slippin' like we old folks
I know all my bitches is some homos
All my young niggas got them old souls
We some young niggas with some old money
You that one nigga, let me hold somethin'
And we got that white girl if your nose runnin'
In the middle of the summer sellin' snow bunnies
I already know you go commando
Me and all my goons up in the bando
I just popped two pills before I saw you
You gon' have to drive my fuckin' Lambo
Xannies always send me off to dreamland
Head startin' to feelin' like a bean bag
I'm goin' through some bullshit at the moment
But all them mothafuckas know I'll be back
You might also like
Pray so much a nigga need some kneepads
Sip so much a nigga need to relax
How the fuck they expect me to relax?
I got crocodile tears under this ski mask
I get so lit, I done forgot what I came to forget
I am a dog, not ashamed to admit
I'm finna pop me a pain pill and sip
I'm finna eat me a mushroom and trip
I'm finna pop with the AK and dip
I am just not feeling Nae Nae and Whip
I'm finna pop me a pain pill and sip

And the pills have eyes, the pills have eyes
And they peek-a-boo at us
They seein' through, through us
It's like pills have eyes, the pills have lives
And they livin' through, through us
Livin' through

I was poured up and poppin' Xans last night
I just pulled up to blow some bands, fast life
I'm so fucked up and now you fuck with me
When you feel me
When I'm cupped up, that's the real me
When I'm cupped up, that's the real me, yeah
She wasn't fuckin' with your ass last night
I was all up in that bitch ass last night
I did my thing and now she fuck with me
And she feel me
When I'm turnt up, that's the real me
When I'm turnt up, that's the real me, yeah
Me and all my goons in the bando
Listenin' to some old school Jay and Jaz-O
Just got new cocaine before I saw you
You gon' have to take a fuckin' sample
Listenin' to some old school Jay and Jaz-O
And we still get the cocaine from Fernando
Prescriptions got me feelin' beaucoup shallow
I ain't got no ceilings in my castle
No Ceilings!9Embed
