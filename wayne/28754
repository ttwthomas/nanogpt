Consider this Evil Empire thing as a threat
Evil Empire

Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't
And I don't need no hook for this shit

Ok now shawty take yo clothes off
And I'mma hit it-I'ma hit it 'til we dose off
And when we wake up, I'mma hit it 'til we dose off
She say her pussy isn't stoppin
I'm like, if that's the case, I'mma beat it like Johnny Cochran
I'm a rocket like Houston, I'm leanin
Ain't nothin between me and you, but this bikini
Now can it I take it off ya?
Rub my tongue across ya
I do it so right, she call me an author
But I am just a Carter
Yeah, I'm just a Carter
Straight to the powder
Yeah, that's what I brought her
Man I swear, I'mma make her cheer like victory
Shawty shawty, you can get speared like Brittany, literally

Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't1Embed
