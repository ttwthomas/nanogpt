10 ContributorsYou Know What Lyrics
I, I got somethin to tell ya girl
I got somethin I wanna do
I, I got somethin to tell ya
I wanna you know what-you know what
Avant holla at 'em

I been lookin for you for a long damn time
But you've been gone away, I nearly lost my mind
An hour in the club and you grindin' on me
Touchin on me, got me goin crazy
That skirt you wearin got a player on swole
As I glance at my watch and see the night is growin' old
I start to reminisce about when we were shorties
Backseat of my Jeep, yes I'm feelin' horny
As I play my position posted up on the wall
Happy to hear the DJ say last call
Cause what that means is we about to leave
And I'm about to be all up on you, and you up on me

Cause I want you
And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down, I'm gonna taste
And when it's all said and done
I'm gonna you know what-you know what
Cause I want you
And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you
And if you let me go down, I'm gonna taste you
And when it's all said and done
I'm gonna you know what-you know what
You might also like
It's hard to keep in touch when you're off in school
But now you're right here we can do what we do
Start in the car and end up in the livin room
Kiss around ya navel while ya on the end table
Push the magazines down on the floor
I'm ya soldier so I'm ready to go to war
And ya told me you're hot and you're ready
Your legs won't stop shakin just give it to me daddy
And I like the way your body's lookin right there
Knowin' we might not even make it upstairs
And what that means is just relax ya mind and baby let it flow
It's goin' down and that's for sure

Cause I want you
And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down, I'm gonna taste
And when it's all said and done
I'm gonna you know what-you know what
Cause I want you
And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you
And if you let me go down, I'm gonna taste you
And when it's all said and done
I'm gonna you know what-you know what
Yeah - fresh off the G-4
Need no intro
Weezy baby nympho
Him so gentle with it, still got mami limbo
Little but he put his thing down like Mutombo
Young though, rich, smart, humble
Got somethin' down low, to make ya walls crumble
Not rough though, slow-mo, promo, we could go video
Uh-oh, hmm, that's right
Nasty it's all in me
How he rap and got women like he R&B
What you know about ya legs in the air
With ya head in the chair, and my hands in ya hair
We could go there if what I'm sayin' sounds fair
Don't trip, I kiss every lip, don't flip
Flip up the doors on the out-of-country whip
I could take you out of this world baby, let's dip

Cause I want you
And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down, I'm gonna taste
And when it's all said and done
I'm gonna you know what-you know what
Cause I want you
And in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you
And if you let me go down, I'm gonna taste you
And when it's all said and done
I'm gonna you know what-you know what
Rock on, just rock on
This is another one of those So-So Def...2Embed
