Ugh! Too many women and not enough time
I'm a cool cat, but I'm on Life Nine
Pimping ain't dead 'cause I be the lifeline
And I don't buy the bar 'cause it don't sell white wine
Go on, let that light shine, balling for a lifetime
Smoking on that nice pine, Weezy baby flight-flying
You can call him your husband, call me at nighttime
And even though women change, I will always like dimes
And yeah, I'm quite fine, but shawty much finer
And I just get behind her and smack it like E. Honda
And please don't hate on me when you see me with Keyana
'Cause she wilder than Nirvana and colder than your honor
Holler at your boy mañana, Maybach come with a recliner
Run up on it and shit will get uglier than an iguana
This is only a reminder, it's Young Money—don't forget it
And I'm Weezy F. Baby, you might find it on her titty
Would you—

Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants (Ugh)
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man (Look)
You might also like
Chilling with my posse, 'bout to call some ladies over (Uh-huh)
Tell them this is YME, so when you come, you can't leave sober (Right)
You would think she came with buttons by the way that I control her (That's right)
Put her on a tab, now she rolling like a baby stroller (Ah)
I’m the freshest niggas seen (Seen), weapon in my jeans (Jeans)
Shoot your lights out, I’m like Redick with the beam (Beam)
Life's a game of chess, and I'm heading for your queen (Uh-huh)
Not my stomach and my thighs, but her head is in between (Eww)
She wetter than a stream (Yeah), I drink medicine to lean (Sipping)
Keep a cup in my hand like I'm begging for some cheese (Haha)
I fall off in the party (Ugh), yeah, I'm kinda tardy (I know)
But if a hater trip, we ride on him like a Harley
Look, you call it "getting married," I call it "acting selfish" (Suckers)
My belt got G's on it like a Packers helmet
And I'ma hit it if you bring your girl around (I promise)
But the weed is like my collar (Why?), 'cause I might just turn it down if you—

Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants (Ugh, Gudda)
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man
Okay, tool on deck (Deck), I'm newborn fresh (Fresh)
I knock your friends down (Down), and you going next (Ha)
Young—Young Money, fly nigga, all the bitches after me (Chyeah)
Murder in the bed, and you gon' be my next casualty (Ha)
Automatic stick, but I give it to her manually
I'm giving dick out year-round, and you can get it annually
Styrofoam filled with a strawberry Fanta treat
Leaning—I'ma need a kickstand to stay on my feet
Get out my business, like I kicks you out my office
I ain't worried 'bout the price; I'm more concerned with the offer
Fresh to death like I got dressed in a coffin
With a party in my pocket, blue and red dolphins
I'm high as a motherfucker, let me do my thing, bitch
I'm doing me, and your girl doing the same shit
I'm in the car, getting head as I lane-switch
D—Double G: I do my thing, bitch! Now, you could—

Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man
Ugh, 'kay, I told you, "Catch up"—did you make a mil' yet?
I can't predict how many of them I can still get
October's Own is such a fucking real set
No tats, but the ink on my money still wet
Life is such a beach; it's sandy all around me
I came here with Young Money, man, that's family all around me
I'm in my living room, and I got Grammys all around me
And famous bitches doing nose candy all around me
Welcome to the life, the life that's meant for me
My Bentley has a tint, and so you got to squint to see
I hollered at your girl; that's when she went with me
But please don't blame yourself, 'cause it just wasn't meant to be
They say I'm one of the illest; that's just off a first impression
And my cards always accepted, I don't deal well with rejection
I look in the dictionary and don't see the word "recession"
I don't smoke in public, but tonight, I'll make an exception, so just—

Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me the ex-man
P—P—Pass me the dutchie with your left hand
I got the whole club nodding like a yes man
I'm in my Polo tee, Gu—Gucci sweatpants
She on that jubilee, call me that ex-man3Embed
