Choppers with drums
Nigga that's how it comes
Assault rifles, extended clips
Let you know where I'm from
The names chopper city
It's a city of niggas bout gettin' funky wit' me
Keep they fingers on triggers
Let's roll with a pistol I get out of control
It's your family I put on rows, front row
I'ma .223 grabber
Bust or block hitter
Project kidnapper
Rookie nigga wig splitter
Make copies for the rapture
It's all on you nigga
Oh, I'm comin' for the capture
What you wan' do nigga
Mystikal's who I'm after
Grab yo' steel and shoot
I'ma killer not just a rapper
Lil' Wayne, he bout it too
I'ma snatch if you got it
Told ya before ta' hide it
Told ya if you hide it
It's a must that I find it
Ride or die bitch
Chop or get chopped ho
B.G. split or get split
Play tha game how it go
Shootin tha drop somethin'
Glock or pop somethin'
AK wit' fifty shots
I tote it to stop somethin'
Make it happen you's the punk
I'll put you in the trunk
 you'll be dumped, nigga I bring funk
You might also like
Let's get funky wit' these niggas
Grab the triggas and blast
Let's get filthy wit' these niggas
Take they figures and dash
Let's get serious with these niggas
Grab the K's and bust, it's ten for one trust
Retaliation a must
Let's get funky wit' these niggas
Grab the triggas and blast
Let's get filthy wit' these niggas
Take they figures and dash
Let's get serious with these niggas
Grab the K's and bust, it's ten for one trust
Retaliation a must

Ah ah
Don't run yo' mouth enough for you to get back in me
My gun clap in it start spinnin' and take many
Plenty of slugs hit you
Can you picture a young rapper
Fourteen year old black master million dollar flapper
Watch me set it off wit' my sawed-off jumpin'
As I be when I be pumpin'
Frontin' gets you nothin'
Runtin' catch a slug from the M-what'n
You ain't bout nothin'
Playa hater leave you bloody
It's money and dreary
Can't see clearly
But ya' still hear me
Four steps comin' quickly
Can you feel me
Better kill me before you get done in
It's real dog
But I got that red mark so when you come in
Slugs somethin', seventeen up in the clip
I keeps extra hollow tips for the crum rip
Should of chop-chop stop yo' whole block
Let's get funky, you want me, I thinks not
So much black clothing you may think its a black-out
All the lights go out
That's when all yo fright come out
Bloody streaks to the UPT where you lays on
I praise on, think you plays on, it's stays gone
The things you lay on
I can't even pay on
You got it, better hide it
If you wanna keep it safe on
I roam to the top
That's my spot, my place
Jumpin' out a suitcase
Slug's chase to yo' face, a
Let's get funky wit' these niggas
Grab the triggas and blast
Let's get filthy wit' these niggas
Take they figures and dash
Let's get serious with these niggas
Grab the K's and bust, it's ten for one trust
Retaliation a must
Let's get funky wit' these niggas
Grab the triggas and blast
Let's get filthy wit' these niggas
Take they figures and dash
Let's get serious with these niggas
Grab the K's and bust, it's ten for one trust
Retaliation a must

Ah, ah, ah, ha
Now as I re-enter this scent and get into you
These three dots, I plot and spot, then I shoot
I keep a chopper under the medium Hilfiger
I throw back punks, comin' out trunks to kill niggas
I spill niggas, on the real nigga I gets dirty
Bury 'em in unknown area where it's deserted
I know you heard it
But you lie and deny it
But you can't hide
It's written all over yo' face you easy to find
Niggas front, scars all over they chest be starting to shine
Like that Presidential Rolex reflex a million nine
Gimme 'dat, all 'dat, and all black, that's my atire
A true rider, gettin' higher off uptown fire
Remember me, the little G never died
Took one to the chest but the little G never died
I'ma certified killer, million dollar nigga
Any kind of gun trigger, clicker, playa hater nigga flipper
Tangerine and juice sipper, disrespectin' bitch flipper
I'm bout drama off the top
You know that's on the foreal-a
I get's loaded low down by a monkey
So call me donkey
Nigga think lame
He would want to know I gets funky
Beef kicked in a night parade
Uptown was deep
'Nother group rollin' out, bookoom be standin' on feet
Now you know I run with ignorant niggas
All of 'em wild
Thousands of people out
Fuck that sprayin' the crowd
Ain't no time for doin' backin' down
From trigga play
Gotta closet of K's
Ready to do it any day
Write grant after tenth
Black grant I was tenths
That's for Al and lil' Duga'
Four deep in each in spinnin' in
So twerk it up
Handle yo' business
Shoot or get shot
I hit blocks wit' Glocks
Nigga, get or get got
In school I was a fool a young flunky
But on the streets I used 2's
Nigga, I gets funky

Let's get funky wit' these niggas
Grab the triggas and blast
Let's get filthy wit' these niggas
Take they figures and dash
Let's get serious with these niggas
Grab the K's and bust, it's ten for one trust
Retaliation a must
Let's get funky wit' these niggas
Grab the triggas and blast
Let's get filthy wit' these niggas
Take they figures and dash
Let's get serious with these niggas
Grab the K's and bust, it's ten for one trust
Retaliation a mustEmbed
