25 ContributorsThird Strike Lyrics
I hope you
I really hope you
I really hope you
Didn't think it was gon' be
I hope you

I hope you didn't think it was gon' be a fist fight, a fair fight
Hope you trained for a gun fight, we thug life
And we do it for the yellowbones, caramels
And them bitches took my cell phone, no paragraphs
My whole squad bout that money making, vice versa
And just like my girl love, I keep a tight circle
Tight circles in the race car, an eye jerker
Or did I mean an eye catcher? Vice versa
Fuck it man, I got too much money, no such thing
Top down on the supersonic, the guts clean
It's time to let our warts sting, I'm upbeat
I'm flier than these motherfuckers with one wing

I'm tired of these motherfuckers, cut strings
I'm first string
Been saying more shit than the nurse seen since thirteen
Don't seem to get why you earthlings observe me
It irks me
The cleanest shit come dirt cheap
I'm dirt deep, to stay awake forever is my worst dream
I search scenes to work schemes on the first fiend at first sight
You know it's paradise when you see blurred lights
You on your third strike
You might also like
Talkin' to myself my homies call me crazy
Livin' by myself my mama say I'm lonely
Sleepin' by myself my bitches think I'm lyin'
Listening to myself cause I'm my favorite artist
Dependent on myself, the people call me mighty
Defending more than self, the people call me hero
I'm good within myself, the people say I'm humble
And I'm protecting myself trying to stay away from evil, Lord

Trapping way before they called it trapping
Pop a Xanny like a motherfucking Aspirin
Got a pocket full of snow, they call me Aspen
Got a Phantom full of smoke while you gasping, uh
Pocket full of stones, talking moonrock
Cause that molly make these broads think they 2Pac
The molly make these niggas think they killers
The molly give my trigger finger the jitters, Lord
I was 15 in a new drop
Pulling up on the scene in the school house
Make a bad bitch cuss her dude out
Wait, I was 15 in a new house
Fucking right, bad bitch, nothing nice
And she something like my fucking wife
But now all we do is fucking fight
I feel like a young nigga can't do nothing right
But my money right, we alright, yeah
Fist fight, a fair fight
Hope you trained for a gun fight, we thug life
And we do it for the yellowbones, caramels
And them bitches took my cell phone, no paragraphs
My whole squad bout that money making, vice versa
And just like my girl love, I Keep it tight circle
Tight circles in the race car, an eye jerker
Or did I mean an eye catcher? Vice versa
Fuck it man, I got too much money, no such thing
Top down on the supersonic, the guts clean
It's time to let our warts sting, I'm upbeat
I'm flier than these motherfuckers with one wing

I was trapping way before they called it trapping
Pop a Xanny like a fucking Aspirin
Pocket full of snow, they call me Aspen
Phantom full of smoke while you gasping, uh
Pocket full of stones, talking moonrock
The molly make these hoes think they 2Pac
The molly make these niggas think they killers
The molly give my trigger finger the jitters
It's Tunechi bitch, I do it for the sippers
It's Tunechi bitch, I do it for the sippers
It's Tunechi bitch, I do it for the strippers
I do it for the cocaine whippers, yeah
Mula baby
TD on the beat
Mannie on the beat
