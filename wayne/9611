7 ContributorsRide or Die Lyrics
Uptown is my home, thats where I do my dirt
I either hurt or get hurt
It's me or you on that shirt
Can't let no nigga fix me
Can't let no nigga get me
I'mma draw and hit first, I can't let no nigga split me
Had my momma upset
Nigga, leave my ho pussy wet
I'm goin out with a fight, my chopper bullets eject
I gets blowed and start
Ready to unload at war
No witnesses
You can't get on the stand and say you saw nothin bout nothin
Keep it shut or you dead
If you can't hush, open your mouth and you'll get ten in your head
That's how I play it nigga, I'll blackmail you wit your own life
It ain't right, disrespect you die on site
That ain't no might, that's a fact
You can believe that
Instead disrespect, I promise to be back
And clear the corner, you can't run, dont try
I'm high, bout mine ready to ride or die bitch

Load it up with black gats and macs
Pay attention to gun blastin
And fake buster harassin
Smashin, dashin up yo street wit all the lights out
Two choppers cocked ready to knot
And chop up yo block
Lock all doors and keep windows closed
Cause we done rolled before
So stay on the floor
We ride deep in the all black camaro
Sittin on mo's
And we rolls tokin on fat optimos
You chose to test those uptown boys
You done got on a straight ride and can't get off
Lets all get a stolen car
And roll through they ward
When it's dark
We spark, pull up then draw
You done falled in war
Got in a big brawl
Thought hard but you wrong
So you still get scarred
Y'all boys done played wit some all out kill niggas
Shuffle ‘em like cards, cut the deck then deal niggas
Still niggas for testin these big lil niggas
Still niggas for messin with these real trill niggas
Young niggas, chopper totin big gun niggas
Front nigga and live your life on the run nigga
Stunt nigga and get plugged, drug through the mud
Puddles of blood flood
You can't swim so you done
Niggas start to look
And see the all black crook
Some booked, some get high
Some hot on one foot
Spots gettin took, whole bodies gettin dropped
Niggas hop, jock, and flock
When I hit they block

Why is you sayin them words, bo janglin, why dont you show yo face
Would you dust me or somthin, you must know you gonna catch a case
I'm a straight head bust ya
Seperate and destruct ya
Dont wanna have no Juvey wanna make a ghost or few
What am I'm supposed to back down or somthin cause you got a lil click
All that frownin and reppin shit
Gone get ya down in a devil ditch
Never miss, I be drivin niggas wit cleverness
Momma used to say this
"Use your mind and stay rich"
Pops used to say "boy dont let them niggas see your weakness"
If a fool get outta line with you knock him off his feet quick
Why is you showin yo teeth you dont speak
Stay on your side of the street, you can't be mobb'n with me
I can't have no bitches followin me
Gotta Mac-10 and you ain't even bust back
And your boy got hit in the back
What type of nigga is that?
That's why I stay in all black
Get the Mac and go back
You done fucked wit C-M-R-ah
They'll be no tomorrow
That's why I stay in all black
Get the Mac and go back
You done fucked wit C-M-R-ah
They'll be no tomorrow

Get you a chopper and tote it
Dont just buy it to have it
Nigga have it to use it
Better grab it and shoot it
Better know one thing nigga will do it to you
Before you do it to them to survive, gotta be true
Nigga think just cause we squashed that beef, thats it
You might be thinkin like me, I think forgive and dont forget
I gotta trick under my sleeve
Ridin four deep wit artillary
Me and Tootie, Papa, and Cleeve
It's an unsolved mystery
I'm a fly til I got ya, yo peoples eyes watery
I hit a artery
Bein real to CMB, it's a part of me
Cross me I charge you wit some flamin hot heat
Two twenty-three blazed all in yo chest
Brain waves you dazed up
You see death stare you straight in your face
Get waked up cause I left ya stretch for the hurse
I take no chance for you to ride, nigga I ride first
So ride or die bitch
Chop or get chopped ho
B.G., split or get split
Play the game how it go
So ride or die bitch
Chop or get chopped ho
B.G., split or get split
