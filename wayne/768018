1 ContributorProm Queen (instrumental) LyricsI loved her fancy underwear
I set behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get
To tell her I'm the one she should be with
Shes' popular with all the guys
So innocent in my eyes
I could see her in my life
She would've had the world if she was mine
But see she had other plans
I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends
Varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day
She laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all
She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen,the prom queen
Is crying sitting outside of my door
She you never know how
How everything could turn around
You might also likeUhh
They loved her fancy underwear
Every boyfriend every year
She tried to keep em entertained
When they can hardly remember her name
She did everything she could just to
To make him love and treat her good
Just to find herself alone
Asking herself where did she go wrong-ong-ong
She didn't realise
She chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties
Trying to apologise
Never forget the day
She laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all
She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen,the prom queen
Is crying sitting outside of my door
She you never know how
How everything could turn around
Get up!
She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen,the prom queen
Is crying sitting outside of my door
She you never know how
How everything could turn aroundEmbed
