21 ContributorsWaist of a Wasp Lyrics
Hey
Woo, sup girl?
Ayy, ayy
Say Wayne
What up dog?
You saw to that?
I see her, I see her, I see her, I see her, I see
Hahaha, sop you up with a biscuit, haha

Lately I been tryin' to stop lyin'
But I'd be lyin' if I said that I wasn't blinded by that ass, girl
And I would go to hell as well
If I said you didn't smell like Victoria's Secret when you passed, girl
And the plaid skirt you got on
Lets a nigga know you just might have some class, girl
So you gotta have you some brain
And with all due respect then you got'sta pass it to Pain, uh
Got'sta pass it to Wayne
And if Wayne pass you on then he pass you to Mack Maine
Or I could take you solo for dolo
Have you gettin' out of the Lamborghini in slow-mo
But I ain't tryna butter you up
I'm tryna fuck you in the kitchen, let me butter you up
Where's my manners?
Which one you like? Butter or syrup?
Let me show you what your Miss Butter is Worth
You might also like
Oh, what it is?
Baby, don't act stupid (oh no)
Come on now let's do this
Got the waist of a wasp and the ass of a horse
And she already know what it is
Baby, you're so perfect (So perfect)
So I know I'm 'bout to murk it (I'm 'bout to murk it)
Got the waist of a wasp and the ass of a horse
And she already know what it is

Shawty want a real nigga
Construction hat Weezy, I'ma build with her
She be my meal after I have a meal with her
Then I deal with her, haha
Now won't you shake like a dog, hop like a frog
Ride it like a horse, scream and holler 'til you lose your voice
Promise I know how to love, know what to do with your heart
Shawty, you so much of a target, I hit you with a dart
Um, bulls eye, baby, ooh aah, baby
Can I stick my finger in your apple pie, baby?
And I know everybody want a piece of the pie
But you know that they ain't greedy as I
Now won't you do it like I told you? Send a pic or download it
'Cause I promise in the Sidekick you got your own folder
If you keep fuckin' with me, you gon' get your own chauffeur
But first put your legs on my shoulders
Oh, what it is?
Baby, don't act stupid (Oh no)
Come on now let's do this (Let's do this)
Got the waist of a wasp and the ass of a horse
And she already know what it is
Baby, you're so perfect (So perfect)
So I know I'm 'bout to murk it (I'm 'bout to murk it)
Got the waist of a wasp and the ass of a horse
And she already know what it is

Now usually I don't go the whole first 9
With a girl on the very first night
But you got the fire to make a nigga feel
Like you supposed to be a nigga's wife
And technically I don't believe in fallin' in love
If the love don't, don't end with love
So with you I'm gon' begin with love, yeah
And really I don't be goin' out like that no more unless it's to shop
But with you I wanna go to the top
Now what you, what you think about that?
What you think about that?
What you think about that?
What you think about that?
Oh, what it is?
Baby, don't act stupid (Oh no)
Come on now let's do this (Let's do this)
Got the waist of a wasp and the ass of a horse
And she already know what it is
Baby, you're so perfect (So perfect)
So I know I'm 'bout to murk it (I'm 'bout to murk it)
Got the waist of a wasp and the ass of a horse
And she already know what it is
Baby, don't act stupid (Oh no) (Oh baby no))
Come on now let's do this (This)
Got the waist of a wasp and the ass of a horse
And she already know what it is (Bitch it's T-Wayne)
Baby, you're so perfect
So I know I'm 'bout to murk it (Young Mula Baby)
Got the waist of a wasp and the ass of a horse
And she already know what it is1Embed
