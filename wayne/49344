23 ContributorsThat’s Not Love Lyrics
Snakes in the grass, so I stay in the pavement
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I’m all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth closed, you wanna know why you die
The answer's right under your nose
Exposed to the street, in the game I don’t cheat
I just play my position, get MVP
I get money, don't shit come free
It’s my life and I run it even when I'm feat
Keep my business in my pockets, don't wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me
See…

That's not love
That's not love

Say what's on your heart if you're real
'Cause the scars you can't see be the hardest to heal
And I used to chase money, now I have it brought
'Cause you can only chase something that you haven't caught
If there's a summertime in hell, it's not as hot
So you empty clip niggas ain't got a shot
These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore
Now you decide if their to die for
Advice to my haters, do what I say now
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down
Thought it was love, how foolish of us
I do me, she do her, sometimes we do each other

That's not love
That's not love

Look, as the crooked world revolves
Love spelt backwards is evol (evolve)
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live
And when death comes you better have lives to give
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs
And rats die ugly, die with kids
These niggas is snitching and still living
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches
Niggas pretend like they actually in
But when it go down they fuck around and be them
That blood look familiar when it’s leaking
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga
That ain't love

That's not love
That's not love

Life is but a dream
Ain't always what it seems
Meanwhile get your cake: red velvet, butter cream
Raise your glass and let's toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!
I see these haters in passing, yeah they ’round
I be on the way up, they be on the way down
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless
Lifestyle A-list, young black and famous
Bunch of bad bitches in an iPod playlist
Just another page in my success story
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me
That’s not love
