Ear Drummers
Mike WiLL Made-It

I am sippin' on that lean, don't bring me no bottles, ho
I make it rain so hard, flowers grow, Hollygrove
Four baby mamas, no baby mama drama
Bad bitch at home sleep, I go home and sleep behind her, uh
Shout out to my weed man, shout out to my lean man
I'm sittin' on these motherfuckin' millions like a beanbag
Fuck you, don't judge me, drug me then love me
Eat me some pussy when I got the munchies
I'm tripping, tell Pippen to beam me up, Scotty
Got pounds of that kush watch me go on a diet
That's no lie, I'm so hot, you pussy ass niggas Massengill
I got them yellow Xanax, I slipped on a banana peel
Trukfit T-shirt, blunt dipped in syrup
Pass that weed around like some fuckin' hors d'oeuvres
Man I'm shit faced and your bitch facin', she high too, fuckin' right
My number one F-A-N, you know what that mean, Fuck All Night, uh

Yeah, I'ma let that breathe
Let that breathe

Uh, nigga I fucked that bitch that's with ya
And she send me naked pictures
If I was you I wouldn't kiss her, you know why?
You know why, yeah, uh, now all my bad bitches say word
You ain't never jocked no nigga, you ain't never sweat no nigga
Yeah, you don't want none of these niggas
Bitch, I ain't one of these niggas, ho
I be doin' my own thing, red bone with a tongue-ring
We get home and she go straight for that head, gun range
Fuck your feelings I'm feelin' me, you want real? That's real as me
Mask on, trick-or-treat, my sign say "Dick for free"
All my homies ride or die, all my bitches ride or die
I look her pussy eye-to-eye then suck that motherfucker dry

Yes Lord
Yeah and she say, "Yes Lord"
Yeah, Dedication 4, ho
Scoob in this bitch with me?7Embed
