12 ContributorsJust Lean Lyrics
Like , like , like, like, like, like, like what you tryna do boy?
I play you like you toy, I know I bring you joy
But no I'm not Anita, I got a heater, no I got two boy
For you and you boys, Screw face retards, Bizzare
She raw, Shawty go in like Hero
Boy I act a donkey heee haaww, We are
Young Money, YM, Young Mula Crew
And we got them bitches like 2 live crew
How do I do? That do I do
Like finger rays
Trust me I have seen the days when the sun would burn like a perm
Make the barrel turn, quicker than usual, this is the usual
My niggas know when to lose you
But it ain't a game though
Give your ass a brain hole
Damn my nigga you fly, hope they bury you in the same clothes

Ohhh
I'm talking bout Young Money lets get em dogs (Get em)
It's such a shame, like Biggie Smalls
Bad bitch, good weed, purple drank, just lean
Now just lean,Yeahhh
Just lean
Tell a bitch lean
See Tyga LiveGet tickets as low as $44You might also likeYeah talking bout
Bad bitch, good weed, purple drank
Just lean (x 2)

Left, right, back, forth, front, back, see-saw
Balancing life as a rap star
Oohh god, they lovin me then they hate me
Then they help when I fall, but how strong is that helpless arm?
Wait this is wrong, don't need your help at all, Tyga got it
Tyga on,They say he raw, Wayne got involved
Compton's own, Mr. Different From Y'all
I call her Miss Macaulay Culkin call, she call me when she home alone
Miss Little Tenant, I be in it like a landlord evicting
Your business, mind your business
Don't want to know the meaning of a witness' statement
Stay within your jurisdiction, cause I'm schooling-schooling niggas
In a whole 'nother district
Gods given, Hell risen, Rap, Pop, Hip-Hop nigga, Def Jam
I make Russel Simmons in the beginning
Young kids admire my finest a big brother figure
No Kanye Jigga
Just Young Money we the illest
G.E.D
Ohhh
Young Money, Get em y'all
It's such a shame, like Biggie Smalls
Bad bitch,Good weed,Purple drank,Just lean
Now just lean,Yeahhh
Just lean
Yeah talking bout
Bad bitch,Good weed,Purple drank
Just leannn (x 2)Embed
