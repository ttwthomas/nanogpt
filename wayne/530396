7 ContributorsDown Lyrics
Young Fearless, baby
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down
Down, down
(Oh)

You oughta know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show
I wanna see how you lose control
So leave it behind, 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape

So baby don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down
You might also like
Just let it be
Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away
Turn this place into our private getaway
So leave it behind, cause we have a night to get away
Come on and fly with me as we make our great escape
So why don't we run away

So baby don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
(Ooh, are you down?)
Are you fuckin' down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
(Ooh, are you down?)
Even if the sky is falling down

Take it down low
Take it down low
Down like she's suppose to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature
'Cause to me she's zero degrees
She's cold, over freeze
I got that girl from over seas
Now she's my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier, please?

So baby don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
(Ooh, are you down?)
Are you fuckin' down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
(Ooh, are you down?)
Even if the sky is falling down
