Bounce! I'm somethin like a phenomenon
The steerin wheel cost a mill that my arm is on
I don't tell no time so my time is wrong
I just use it for a settin for diamonds on
Listen pull up to the club and make the whole club STOP (STOP)
Now go to the floor and make the whole club DROP (DROP)
And tell the DJ I ain't never 'gon STOP (STOP)
And anything here you ain't never 'gon cop
Listen, peek-a-boo when I'm speakin at you
And her Victoria's Secrets that I'm seein through
You say that's your girlfriend are you meetin her too?
You say you want more fun with me and my crew, come on!!!

I am, up in the club, my liquors in here
My cars in the club, 'cause I don't really care
My doors in the air, cause we up in here
HERE, HERE, HERE - oh yeah!
Sittin in the back, got ten stacks on lap
She said that thang look like the grill of a Cadillac
Naw, that's just the way my money laps
Yeah, now girl can you make ya ass clap? {*clapping*}
RUGH!! My swagger's crazy
She got her ass up, like "Can I have your baby?"
I sat her ass down like, "Naw, girl are you crazy?
GETCHO' hand out my pocket! You gets no gravy!!"

Oh! She feelin herself
But wit'out me that feelin's unfelt
She get loose, she loosin her belt

Drink that drank befo' the ice melt
And she don't want no water! She ain't Mike Phelps!

And she go and tell her friends how good I felt, yeah!
