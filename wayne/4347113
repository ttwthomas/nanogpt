They say I need to get back on my rap shit (My rap shit)
I say they need to get a fuckin' pap smear, lil' bitch
The greatest of all time, check my stats, bitch (Check my stats, bitch)
But you look like Wayne, you sound like Wayne, we gettin' catfished?
Callin' me a has-been when the only thing I have been
Is everything they haven't been
Looking like my mannequins
Somethin' like some amateurs, I call 'em Tunechi Scavengers
I need to sue they managers
All these lil' robots, do they even include the batteries?
Kiss my gluteus maximus
This ain't that and that ain't this, feel like I been cloned, dawg
I just cut your song off, that shit sound like womp-womp
I just cut some me on, that shit lit like neon
Grammys on my shelf
I know some bitches that deserve they panties on my shelf
But they didn't have no underwear
I'm on a planet somewhere else, on a Xan and somethin' else
If these rappers is my sons, as a parent, I have failed
I'm the G.O.A.T
I don't even fuckin' write, but one motherfuckin' quote
Is better than everything you ever motherfuckin' wrote
That's true, she got a G.O.A.T. tattoo
I got a G.O.A.T. statue, you gotta quote that too
From the G.O.A.T. mouth10Embed
