Mange Strusic! Bang bou yitch!
Follow me now see, check it out
I say: this song is dedicated to the ball droppers
But I'mma switch the letters around and say drall boppers!
We coming to get ya so get the message to all coppers
That you need protection or you better have ch'all yoppers!

What a shame when a thang blast at ya
'Cause you're lame, you a dame slash actor
These dudes are hoes, from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards

Tecca N9na 'bout to hit 'em wit the woop wop
Now the barrel of my governor is hoo tot
'Cause you the type that'll get your whole shew crot
Loud mouth nigga tripping, thinking that he Putac
Got a strong hand, I'm a mown gran
Little boy, now you fuckin' with the clong wran
Oh, you just showboating? It's over now, y'all can quit
'Cause you can get it for something mere as shalkin' tit
Just a cone phall, then it's on, y'all
Fuck around and get you dome sawed off a brone stawl
I can't wait to hear you squeal and holler
How you set trippin' when you got a multi-dillion mollars, nigga?
Stupid, such a sucker
Nuck figgas always got to make a totha bruch her
Never had no problem taking down another buster
'Cause they be doing shit bass ackwards, fothermucka
You might also like
What a shame when a thang blast at ya
'Cause you're lame, you a dame slash actor
These dudes are hoes from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards
What a shame when a thang blast at ya
'Cause you're lame, you a dame slash actor
These dudes are hoes from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards

I'm Yo Gotti, the drug dealer
I'm Yo Gotti, the thug nigga
I'm Yo Gotti, my own hitter
And if you wanna ODX, then say Yo Gotti the plug, nigga
I've been getting money for a long time
You've been banging, throwing up the wrong sign
Pussy ass nigga, you a cross-gender
Fuckboy, you a ho, nigga
And you remind me of my ho, nigga
Nothing I hate worser than a broke nigga
Got a Tec-9, and an AK, and a FN
Got a white Vette, and a white Ghost, and a white Benz
I ain't running with niggas, 'less I'm getting money with niggas
I don't act funny with niggas, keep it a hundred with niggas
Kept a thousand with niggas, I ran in houses with niggas
I put in work with the squad, we even sold flour to niggas
But, fuck
What a shame when a thang blast at ya
'Cause you're lame, you a dame slash actor
These dudes are hoes from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards
What a shame when a thang blast at ya
'Cause you're lame, you a dame slash actor
These dudes are hoes from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards

Bass ackwards, synonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming, maintaining that they factors
When'd you push a package? When'd you ever clap shit?
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I shook this place and had to find some space before
I killed one of these rap niggas and ate they fucking face
Outta place in this rap game, biggest mistake I ever made
Hit rewind and de-line, deleting everything I laid
Far from a rap nigga, I don’t lie for fun
Fuck fame and fuck you, and fuck him, and her, too
N9na called the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob and this ain’t 'bout dope?
Bass ackwards

These niggas ass backwards
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laughin'
It's funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spelling "stressed" backwards, dessert with my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R&R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit
So frankly, I'm stalking Ben Franklin
I am Wayne Carter, oops, I meant Cayne Warter
Cocaine on back order
Flip you ass backwards
Bitch, you are bass ackwards if you think that's awkward
