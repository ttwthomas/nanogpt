51 ContributorsCan’t Believe It Lyrics
She make me feel so good
Better than I would by myself
Or if was with somebody else
You don't understand she make the people say yeah yeah

I can put you in the log cabin
Somewhere in Aspen
Girl ain't nothing to the Pain
Ain't tricking if you got it what you asking for
Put you in the mansion
Somewhere in Wisconsin
Like I said ain't nothing to the Pain
We can change that last name, what's happening
Cause you look so good
Tell me why you wanna work here
I put you on the front page of a King Magazine
But you gon get yourself hurt here

Baby I brought you in the back just to have a conversation
Really think you need some ventilation
Let's talk about you and me

Oh, I can't believe it
Ooo ooo she all on me, on me
Man man I think she want me, want me
Nah I can't leave her lonely, now
Oh, I can't believe it
Ooo ooo she all on me, on me
Man man I think she want me, want me
Nah I can't leave her lonely, now
And you don't understand she make the people say yeah, yeah, yeah
She hit the main stage she make the people say yeah, yeah, yeah
See T-Pain LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
I could put you in the condo
All the way up in Toronto
Baby put you in the fur coat
Riding the Murciélago
I put you in the beach house
Right on the edge of Costa Rica
Put one of em lil' flowers in your hair
Have you looking like a fly mamacita, fuego
Cause you look so good
You make me wanna spend it all on you
Get up out this club
Slide with your boy
We can do what you wanna, yeah

Baby I brought you in the back cause you need a little persuasion
Plus you need a little ventilation
Let's talk about you and me

Oh, I can't believe it
Ooo ooo she all on me, on me
Man man I think she want me, want me
Nah I can't leave her lonely, now
Oh, I can't believe it
Ooo ooo she all on me, on me
Man man I think she want me, want me
Nah I can't leave her lonely, now
And you don't understand she make the people say yeah, yeah, yeah
She hit the main stage she make the people say yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I can put your ass out
Keep running your mouth
And if your brothers come tripping
I'mma show em what these teardrops bout
Shawty I was just playing
Oh but I can take you to the Cayman Islands
Have you screaming and hollering
We gonna be making
Love on the beach
The people see what we doing
Aww, they pointing and ooing
Oh but we gone keep on doing it
Like it's just me and you and no one else around
It went down on the balcony
And I ain't talking no penthouse suite
Shawty like a model out the Penthouse Sheets
That's why I got her on my Penthouse Sheets

Oh, I can't believe it
Ooo ooo she all on me, on me
Man man I think she want me, want me
Nah I can't leave her lonely, naw
Oh, I can't believe it
Ooo ooo she all on me, on me
Man man I think she want me, want me
Nah I can't leave her lonely, naw
And you don't understand she make the people say yeah, yeah, yeah
She hit the main stage she make the people say yeah, yeah, yeah22Embed
