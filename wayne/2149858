23 Contributors4 My Dawgs Lyrics
Cry little sister
Thou shall not fall
Come, come to your brother
Thou shall not fly

This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy
Fuck you, pay me, fuck you, pay me
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy
Goin' crazy, fuck you, pay me
This for my dawgs out here

Now you wanna be friends
You the type to fuck a nigga for his pension
All a nigga ever wanted was a 6 Benz
And if you a bad bitch, come get the dick again
They be like... oh wait
Step up in the spot and they screamin' oh aye
Which one of y'all wanna chill? OJ
We sippin' Moet champagne
On me, all the bitches on me
See Tyga LiveGet tickets as low as $44You might also like
Cry little sister
Thou shall not fall
Come, come to your brother
Thou shall not fly

This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy
This for my dawgs out here goin' brazy
Goin' crazy, fuck you, pay me
You ain't alone out here, I'm goin' crazy
I'm right there with you
We right here with you

I met some models, they said life full of obstacles
Challenges and mobster rules and Libyan size pools
Hold my breath and take 2, anxieties and robberies
Survival, threats, apologies, I made it through the poverty
I be... on my own shit
Cause you never, never know when somebody gon' trip
Oh shit, miss a nigga with that bullshit, man
Aye bossman, I'm my own bossman, understand?
Cry little sister
Thou shall not fall
Come, come to your brother
Thou shall not fly

This for my dawgs out here goin' cray-cray
Goin' cray-cray, got that AK
Point it at your bay-bay, we goin' crazy
We goin' crazy, fuck you, pay me
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy
We goin' crazy, fuck you, pay me
For my dawgs out here goin' crazy
Goin' crazy, yeah

T-Y-G-A, we goin' crazy
Young, Young, Young Mula baby
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy
Fuck you, pay me, fuck you, pay me

This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy
Goin' crazy, goin' crazy
This for my dawgs out here goin' crazy
Goin' crazy, they goin' crazy
Cry little sister
Thou shall not fall
Come, come to your brother
Thou shall not fly
(I'm goin' crazy)
Unchain me, sister
Thou shall not steal
Love is with your brother
Thou shall not kill20Embed
