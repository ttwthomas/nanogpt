87 ContributorsTunechi Rollin’ Lyrics
G5 sittin' on the runway
Big-ass chopper, call that bitch "Beyoncé"
This for my dawgs locked down all day
Money, power, respect; three the hard way
I put some real niggas on their feet, boy
So they'll kill anyone for me, boy
Yeah, YMCMB, boy
Young Tunechi, fresh to death, Rest In Peace, boy

My gat bang, your hat hang, I ride off with Mack Maine
I drink Patron straight, you niggas keep that champagne
My Pa is the Birdman, I'm rich as a white man
I come to your show and kill you and your hype man
We rollin', let's roll out, my bitches don't hold out
They got Marley G, I gotta bond my lil bro out
Let my dreads grow out, my bitch got a blow out
Mi casa, su casa; my house is a ho house
Only fuck with real niggas, Polo, fuck that Hilfiger
Yeah, I'm on a pill, nigga, feed you to my lil niggas
Shout out to my big homies, Fee-Fee and T-Streets
Scope on that AK, make me take a sneak peek
T, roll another one, razor blade under tongue
You ain't never seen this watch, nigga, this a one of one
You niggas is Honey Bun, your girlfriend a ton of fun
Chopper with a drum, motherfucker, give the drummer some
Blunt fat like my blunt a thumb, suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Pop that pussy for me, then wild out and give my niggas some
I'ma do my thing, I put that on Nicki Minaj
I need a bad redbone to come give my dick a massage
I'm talkin' big money, I'm talkin' heavyweight
I cut down on the syrup, now I'm in better shape
I'm from New Orleans, nigga, where you ain't never safe
You fuck with me, I drop you off in front of Heaven gates
Okay, jump off a buildin', jump out a window
Smoke like a junkie and fuck like a nympho
Drink like a goldfish, that's right, you know this
Hold up; Click-clack! Okay, I'm reloaded
Fuck with Lil Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Wild as Ryu, I hit you with that "Hadouken"
My money too long, nigga, my weed too strong, nigga
Fuck everybody, I'm in my own zone, nigga
You might also like
Uh, and every time you see me I'm wet
And I'm rollin', Tunechi, Rest In Peace, fresh to death
And I'm rollin', 'bout to fuck a bitch I just met
'Cause she rollin', nigga, we rollin', nigga, I'm rollin'
Gotta keep a towel, I'ma sweat
'Cause I'm rollin', goin' at a bitch nigga neck
'Cause I'm rollin', damn, ma, I ain't come yet
'Cause I'm rollin', bitch, I'm rollin'

Young Mula, baby
