3 ContributorsKissin On My Tattoos (Remix) Lyrics
New Orleans boys
You heard me

I got that ratchet on me few pills on me
A young bitch with no miles on her
She don’t suck dick then I don’t want her
Cause I know I'ma go down on her
I know she think I gon' throw thous on her
I'ma kill that pussy throw flowers on her
Act like it's mine like I'm a proud owner
Then I'ma get ghost town on her
I'ma give her head 'til her toes curl
We gon' conversate we gon' soul search
She asked if I fucked her home girl
I froze up its a cold world
I smoke fat blunts and white boys
No pun intended
It ain't no fun if the hommies can't have none she stingy
If she nasty she get commended
If she classy she get suspended
If she passive freak and friendly
And she bring something to swim in
Then bitch get on my wave, bitch get on my wave
She kiss me on my tats and I kiss her on her cat

Baby I don't blame you
For being in the clubs
And getting all that love
Cause you're so beautiful
God made you to show that off
Now I ain't ever been the jealous type of guy
But I want you to myself, I can't lie
I know we ain't on no one on one thing
But baby, It should change

Cause when I be out with other chicks, I be thinking bout you
And when you be out on dates, you be texting me too
Telling me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God, he ain't breaking you off

I don't want nobody but you
Kissin on my tattoos
I don't want nobody but me
Talkin to you
Until you fall asleep
We better stop playing (We better stop playing)
Before we mess around and someone gets hurt
I don't want nobody but you (nobody but you)
Kissin' on my tattoos
Nobody But you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody But you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody But you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody But you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me

All my homies wanna know what's up with us
They can't believe that I'm kickin' it with just one girl
But I'm cool with that
Them pretty eyes and that smile
Girl, I'm a fool for that (yeah I'm a fool for that)

Cause when I be out with other chicks, I be thinking bout you
And when you be out on dates, you be texting me too
Telling me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God, he ain't breaking you off
I don't want nobody but you
Kissin on my tattoos
I don't want nobody but me
Talkin to you
Until you fall asleep
We better stop playing (We better stop playing)
Before we mess around and someone gets hurt
I don't want nobody but you (nobody but you)
Kissin' on my tattoos

Nobody But you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody But you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody But you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
Nobody But you
Kissin' on me
Kissin' on me
