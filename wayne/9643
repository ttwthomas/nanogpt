Nigga I got these hoes iced up enough
While my lil' B.G.'s on the bus puttin' out cigarette butts
But me, personally, playboy I don't give a fuck
And I'mma always show love to my cut
Hit the club, light the bitch up
The Cash Money motto is to drink 'til we throw up
Nigga point the ho out, guaranteed I can fuck
Woadie, I'm tattooed and balled up
Medallion iced up, Rolex bezelled up
And my pinky ring is platinum plus
Earrings be trillion cut and my grill be slugged up
My heart filled with anger cause nigga I don't give a fuck
Stack my cheese up, cause one day I'ma give this street life up
Beef I don't discuss, a nigga outta line gon' get his motherfuckin' head bust
Cash Money Millionaires plus
Don't touch sum'in nigga you can't fuck
Twenty inches TV is a must
By the year two thousand I'm gut out my bus

A lil' nigga seventeen playin' with six figures
Got so much ice you can skate on a nigga
When you see Cash Money you know we stay flossin'
Catch ya girl down bad ya know we straight tossin'
I ain't seen a clique yet that can stunt like mine
I ain't seen a Maro that can run like mine
1999, and it's our turn to shine
Fifty or better on our wrist and they all blind
Pourin' vodka 'til I die drank 'til I faint
'Til a nigga tell me I need another drank
My nigga Baby told me work nigga trick to them hoes
Nigga Baby told me work nigga better than treatin' yo nose
I'm the freak of the clique
Keep it on the tuck
So I creep on a bitch and I play it the raw
Never sleep with a bitch, keep it real with my niggas
Never weep for a bitch, never weep for a bitch nigga

Bling bling, every time I come around your city
Bling bling, pinky ring worth about fifty
Bling bling, every time I buy a new ride
Bling bling, Lorinsers on Yokohama tires
Bling bling, every time I come around your city
Bling bling, pinky ring worth about fifty
Bling bling, every time I buy a new ride
Bling bling, Lorinsers on Yokahama tires

It's the nigga with the Lex bubble
Candy-coated helicopter with the leather cover
If ya suckin' not fuckin' take off the rubber
Then toss that bitch nigga cause I don't love her
Balla, Manny bought a private plane
Then turned around and sold that bitch to Juve and Wayne
They put thirty-inch Lorinsers on that thing man
I know you niggas out there just don't understand

I'm a 1999 driver, I'm a uptown Third Ward, Magnolia T.C. rider
Ol' ignorant ass always stuntin'
Big ballin' ass nigga you can see him when he comin'
Booted up, diamond up, golds be shinnin' up
Muthafuckas be blindin' up
Niggas at the second line be sayin, I'll be damned
Up in they best fits sayin', Juve got me again
Bling bling, every time I come around your city
Bling bling, pinky ring worth about fifty
Bling bling, every time I buy a new ride
Bling bling, Lorinsers on Yokohama tires
Bling bling, every time I come around your city
Bling bling, pinky ring worth about fifty
Bling bling, every time I buy a new ride
Bling bling, Lorinsers on Yokahama tires

I be that nigga with the ice on me
If it cost less than twenty it don't look right on me
I stay flossed out all through the week
My money long if you don't know I'm the B.G
I be fuckin niggas bitches all in they home
Niggas be like, "Look at that Benz on all that chrome"
Diamonds worn by everybody thats in my click
Man I got the price of a mansion 'round my neck and wrist
My nigga Baby gettin' a special built machine
A Mercedes Benz Wagon 700 V14
I know you niggas can't believe that
I can't wait to see ya haters face when ya see that
Man look at that
Niggas wear shades just to stand on side of me
Hoes say take that chain off boy ya blindin' me
All day my phone ringin' bling bling bling
Can see my earring from a mile bling bling
Bling bling, every time I come around your city
Bling bling, pinky ring worth about fifty
Bling bling, every time I buy a new ride
Bling bling, Lorinsers on Yokohama tires
Bling bling, every time I come around your city
Bling bling, pinky ring worth about fifty
Bling bling, every time I buy a new ride
Bling bling, Lorinsers on Yokohama tires
Bling bling, every time I come around your city
Bling bling, pinky ring worth about fifty
Bling bling, every time I buy a new ride
Bling bling, Lorinsers on Yokahama tires

Tell me what kind-a, nigga got diamonds that'll fuckin blind ya
Tell me what kind-a, nigga got diamonds that'll fuckin blind ya
Tell me what kind-a, nigga got diamonds that'll fuckin blind ya
Tell me what kind-a, nigga got diamonds that'll fuckin blind ya
Uh, bling bling, what? Bling bling what?
