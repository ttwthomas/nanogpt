35 ContributorsGrindin’ (Remix) Lyrics
Back yard to yard (Oh), yeah
What's the size of them rims on that car nigga, huh? (Grindin')
Can they see that chain from afar, nigga, huh? (Grindin')
What ya game be like? (Grindin')
What ya chain be like? (Grindin')
So what ya name be like? (Grindin')
Ma, it don't get more ghetto than this

You see I'm grimy-minded, you've been blinded
Lookin' for a beat like mine, you can't find it
You hear the Clipse and N.O.R.E., gotta rewind it (Beep-beep)
Nowadays you get on the run and get finded
(Grinding) You know I got guns
Why you actin like my daughters? You know I got sons
(Grinding) Nah, we won't speak, fam
Aiming at ya collar bone, hit ya in ya cheek, fam
Grinding

From ghetto to ghetto to backyard to yard
I sell it whipped or un-whipped, it's soft or hard
Stand on that table, nigga, spit that Cris, nigga
Throw that chair, make 'em recognize this raw
Playa, look-a here
I'm great in the kitchen like Corning cookware
Uncle Jemima with my braids wrapped
And three-minute recipes for cookin' flapjacks
Coke price through the roof, SL, blew the coupe
My niece askin' how my rims bigger than a hula-hoop
Cuzzo, I make the block holla
Take it back to childhood how the scale teeter-totter
As I evolve, weight grew heavy
It was kinda like my buddy just fell off the see-saw
Bricks in the muffler, MAC-11 touch ya
Virgina's hustler, I'm here, motherfucker

What's the size of them rims on that car nigga, huh? (Grindin')
Can they see that chain from afar nigga, huh? (Grindin')
What ya game be like? (Grindin')
What ya chain be like? (Grindin')
So what ya name be like? (Grindin')
Ma, it don't get more ghetto than this

I'm Big Tymin'
In a bubble-eye Lex, so fly and (So fly, so fly)
I cook, cut crack, that's besides me
Them big, big rims on tires and we shinin'
Me and Weezy (Holla, holla)
Gold rims, can't see me (Holla, holla)
New Benz on tweezies (Holla, holla)
Cadillac truck beamy, fo' sheezy (Brr)

From hood to hood, bitch nigga, yard to yard
Hey I'm your hero cause I've got that heroin and that raw
Check the rims on my car
Nah, don't check 'em, though, 'cause they stuffed with blow
Weezy Baby, still in the kitchen
Just put a little curve on the shit I'm pitchin'
You need a hit like Mark McGwire, come holla
I'll watch the base at home, I'm umpire
Grindin' (Woah)
You know what I keep in the lining (Woah)
Niggas better stay in line when (Woah)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (Grinding)
Grindin' (Woah)
You know what I keep in the lining (Woah)
Niggas better stay in line when (Woah)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (Grinding)

Took 13 South, cross the Bay Bridge with it
Ring the triangle, dinner bell, come and get it
The time in the kitchen, I dare not mention
When my cell phone echo, I swear they listening
'89 was my beginning, y'all
Young snot-nose, stashed yams in a tennis ball
Cops swore we was playing catch, no
We was adding stretch, no shorts, beg 'til you outta breath
I ducked the feds, they seeing my weight grow
Streets love Malice for his comeback ratio
If they got popped, we made sure they made bail
'Cause if not, we be scared they gon tell
Patty cake, that's me, bake the pies
Pyrex, mix that, scrape the sides
Grindin', Glock-9 in the lining
May God strike a nigga dead if he lying
What's the size of them rims on that car nigga, huh? (Grindin')
Can they see that chain from afar nigga, huh? (Grindin')
What ya game be like? (Grindin')
What ya chain be like? (Grindin')
So what ya name be like? (Grindin')
Ma, it don't get more ghetto than this
What's the size of them rims on that car nigga, huh? (Grindin')
Can they see that chain from afar nigga, huh? (Grindin')
What ya game be like? (Grindin')
What ya chain be like? (Grindin')
So what ya name be like? (Grindin')
Ma, it don't get more ghetto than this2Embed
