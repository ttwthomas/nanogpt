15 ContributorsBad Side LyricsIntro:
Stepping to the bad side (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Gonna take a mean ride (ooh, ooh, ooh)
The smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay
Stepping to the bad side today

Real nigga, I just can't be fake
Fake niggas they just can't be real
Hot boy I just can’t be chilled
So hot I'm a walking kettle
Man these boys can’t get on my level, they never could
All white phantom directing it through the hood
Real soft leather my dash is cherry wood
Big four 5th that’s working very good
Got a driver named Wood-row
Opens the door, Sui - ci - dal
He holds the umbrella, I hops outta the back
And tell Rosa Parks it’s where I sat
I'm a dog but I'm like a cat to a rat
If he don’t run he get scratched Rrrrraaaaooo
And when it comes to the 4 stain
I'm like old school Harlem shit, that Rich Port thang
I gave him narc
I gave him crack
Now it’s time to introduce him to morphine
You're playing with the wrong one
My mama had 4 boys, you're playing with the wrong son
They say Ladies Love Cool J
Well the J is for Juelz and the ladies love me
And if the bitch ain’t fine
I don’t mind
2 nickels make a dime every time
These boys acting like worthless hoes
But their career is like the car they be in, the curtains closed
They want war let’s get it now
They want beef I give them a cow
You don’t wanna get on my bad side
I leave them with no neck like fat guys
Don’t be playing with me, I ad-vise
I make them Chinese food, another cat fried
And don’t compare them to me there is no comparison
I'm from another planet like aliens
Shark In The Water, there is no scaring them
These fish belong in aquariums
So keep acting like Conan boy and we will see who is the real barbarian
They acting like bad pets and yes I'm a veterinarian
You don’t wanna see me act mean
And don’t watch me I'm not a flat screen
I'm Pay-Per-View you know what that means
You gotta pay for this BITCH!!

Let’s Go
Hard body I can’t even bend
Nor fold I'm cold like the wind
Or North Pole I froze all my limbs
Too much ice I'm a walking bezzle
That’s why you niggas couldn’t get on my level and never could
All Black Phantom directing it through the hood
Black butter soft my dash is black too
My driver is black too
My driver is strapped too
Lil Wayne I'm live as Act 2
But this is no movie script
More like an Uzi clip
I'm into Uzi clips
Spit like an Uzi
I spit like I just jumped into Uzi clips
Nigga who is you with
I can move your clique
All I got to do is let loose with this Uzi clip
I'm an Uzi bitch
Know the rules and shit around here we wear red like a Hoosier bitch
Now after that there comes a smell
And after that welcome to hell
I hope your situation comes to well
Cause I will bust your ass like a lobster tail
I put it into her mouth like Akinyele
And me I get high like a doctor bill
So I sha – ll
Fuss with the kitchen, telling me he ain’t got no pot to sell
17th ward is where I prevail
And I run them streets like a soccer field
You looking at hot for real
And I'm rolling on this bitch like I popped a pill
And I don’t mean David, when I say it, when it comes to marijuana I will cop a field
Just tryna get my proper meal and eat my shit at the top of the hill
That’s the good side
Never look back it’s ya bad side
You on the bad side
Hey, and you don’t wanna see my bad side
You would wanna be my ally
And I believe that I can fly
Not like R.Kelly, he a damn lie
Weezy
Write it in the sand, I hope the wind doesn’t blow for eternity2Embed
