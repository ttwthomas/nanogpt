Pi' 'til I die
Just because!
Pi' 'til I die
Piru
B's up
Bitch, I'm me

Young Money is the label, let us in the door
Coming in this bitch, all red to the floor
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
I got Bloods on stage, Bloods at my shows
Fuck with my Bloods, got blood on your clothes
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!

Once again, it's on—yeah, I'm back in the booth
Stand at the top like a tack in the roof
Still on these hoes like a mack in a suit
Still on my toes, not a crack in my shoe
Rappers talking 'bout me, but I don't give a hoot
These niggas still lying, I'm the motherfucking truth
Talk tough 'til I knock off your kuf'
And I own my team, I'm like a Maloof
They hating on me, I'm just tryna be Weezy
Just like Young Jeezy in a lima-bean 'Ghini
Smoked out my mind, baby, now I'm seeing 3D
Dopeboy fresh from my fitted to my DC's
All red, so these hoes know who we be's (B's up)
We be's Bloods—we B's
Popeye flow, y'all niggas Sweet Peas
Getting high on a yacht—call it "seaweed"
You might also like
Young Money is the label, let us in the door
Coming in this bitch, all red to the floor
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
I got Bloods on stage, Bloods at my shows
Fuck with my Bloods, got blood on your clothes
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!

I advance my flow, and they must like that
They like it so much, they say they write that
Barking at the dog, but I don't bite back
I ain't CPR, I ain't bringing they life back
Black CBR, bad bitch on the bike back
Skittles on my wrist, yeah, nigga, the bright pack
I'ma shine, I live where the light at (You dig?)
Air Force fly, call me a Nike check
Brand-new coupe same color as the sky
The dash say 2, y'all know I'm gon' try
Cop pull me over, y'all know I'm gon' lie
They go up in my trunk, y'all know I'm gon' fry
Them niggas throwing salt all over my fries
So I'ma just walk all over them guys
Niggas throwing darts, never hit the bullseye
Young Money, bitch, New Orleans, East Side
Young Money is the label, let us in the door
Coming in this bitch, all red to the floor
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo! (Neck music)
I got Bloods on stage, Bloods at my shows
Fuck with my Bloods, got blood on your clothes
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!

Been around the world, rep the same thing
Been around the world, it's the same gang
B's up, B's up, flame gang
Blaat, b-blaat, blaaa-blaaat, bang-bang
I told my homie Streets, "You can't sleep on life"
So he popped a X pill and didn't sleep all night
I ain't worrying 'bout you, I'm just trying do me
Last album did two, I'm just trying do three
I am what every pair of eyes ought to see
Bitches wish they could just call and order me
My Momma used to tell me "Get a nine-to-five"
Cash Money made her say, "Never mind, I'm fine" (B's up!)

Young Money is the label, let us in the door
We coming in this bitch, all red to the floor
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo! (Just because!)
I got Bloods on stage, Bloods at my shows
Fuck with my Bloods, got blood on your clothes
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
And I'm Blooded—soo-woo!
Piru, to Damu
