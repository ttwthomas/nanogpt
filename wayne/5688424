Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare, ha

Weezy Baby, tell 'em we amazin'
Better yet an Army, the U.S. Navy
Then tell Slim, I was raised on Cash Money
They can't kick me out of shit, I ain't Dame Dash dummy
I'm the ( ) pass a hundred in that red Ferrari
Me and Weezy Blood brothers, we got red Ferraris
Red tops in the hood, red tops on Bacardi
Red tops on top models at the after party
Before S dot Carter was Brooklyn's step-father
I was getting G money like Nino at the Carter
I was just a baby, like the face on the third Carter
Even had a baby face, like Tracy Evan's baby father
Nigga, so you know what I mean
When I say I get the money like a money machine, yeah
I'm in L.A. Gasol-in'
But when I'm in New Orleans, you can call it Chris Paul-in'
You might also like
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare, ha

Okay, holla at ya blood
It's Big Dog Weezy, in that big dog breezin'
With the wig off, it ain't easy to go this hard
But Weezy go this hard, like pussy right in front me
I get pussy, I get money, I don't get none of ya'll niggas
Like two, three, I'm after every one of ya'll niggas
What am I saying? I'm ahead of all of ya'll niggas
And mine gon' shine like Armor All hit us
Hah! I wear that chopper like a uniform
You bitch niggas never see me like a unicorn
Who the boy make the girls go crazy
I got that Red Magic, unbelievable, amazin'
Hey, it's a beautiful day
I'm feelin' like the father of a sun ray
Like Jamie, Foxx or box like Floyd May'
If the weather right, I play the red box Porsche-ay
C'mon
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare, ha

We in the house like a home invasion
And this time I'm gon' shine like the chrome on Dayton's
You can wait on Detox or you can have more patience
Baby sip that patrone as we get wasted
Weezy, we sip lean, me I just taste it
We be soakin' up syrup like a waffle house apron
Infrared beam go back to the basement
I'mma street king, ask dude from the Matrix
Yeah, Cash Money in the basement
Me and Slim like the Hot Boys with a face lift
Translation, it's Freddy versus Jason
Who your favorite rapper, me and Weezy will erase them
And if they gettin' money then, we will paper chase them
With beams that glow in the dark like Kanye's stage shit
Then we highjackin' Kanye's spaceship
And land it on the Red Carpet at the VMA's bitch
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare, haEmbed
