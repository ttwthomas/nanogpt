25 ContributorsJust In Love (Remix) Lyrics
Young Mula, baby
I'm just in love with you, baby

I love a girl in a whole 'nother language
Pople look at us strange
Don't understand us, they try to change it
I try to tell her "Don't change"

We talk love and they say it sounds crazy
Love's even more wild when you're angry
Don't understand why you wanna change it
(Girl, listen to me)

You're just running from the truth
But I'm scared of losing you
You are worth too much to lose
Baby, if you're still confused (Girl, I'm just)

Girl, I'm just in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Girl, I'm just in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
No other words to use (Yeah, yeah)
I'm just in love with you (Yeah, yeah, ayy, Joe, I got you, yeah)
I'm just (Yo) in (Tunechi) love with (Baby) you
Ah (Yeah) yeah
You might also like
Okay, ain't no love like the one I got
I'm a prisoner of love, got my heart on lock
It's like a star from the sky fell by my side
And she tell me that it's mine, and I say, "That's fine"
And she look like a butterfly, smell like a flower
Man, we go together like money and the power
And I don't need nothin', nothin' but her
'Cause all them other bitches ain't fuckin' with her
And the smile on her face make the world a better place
But she out of this world, so we somewhere out in space
Makin' love like animals, Planet Of The Apes
All night, all mornin', too bright, pull the drapes
Man, we just doin' what we does
The tank on E, yeah, just enough
And we just be, yeah, just because
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm just in love
Girl, I'm just in love (Joe!)

I'm just in love with you (Haha, did you hear what I said?)
Girl, I'm just in love with you (Can't nobody change it?)
No other (Woah) words to use (I love you, baby)
I'm just in love with you (I'm just in love with)
I'm just in love with you (I'm just in love)
I'm just in love with you
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Never knew what we have
They don't understand
Words are just a waste of time
We know this is real
I don't know how you feel
When you put your hand in mine

Girl, I'm just in love with you (Yeah, haha)
Girl, I'm just in love with you (YMCMB)
No other words to use (Woo)
I'm just in love with you (Let me say it again, let me say it again)
I'm just in love with you (Just in love, just in love, Young JJ)
I'm just in love with you (That's how we do it, oh, baby)

I'm just in love with you, baby (Oh, baby)
I mean ever since you came into my life (Oh, baby), my life has changed (Oh, baby)
For the better (The better)5Embed
