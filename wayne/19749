Oooooowwwww! (Ha ha, chyeah)

Let's make it rain on these niggas (Joey Crack)

Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror
Got a hand full of stacks, better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I'm in this bitch with the Terror
Got a handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I make it rain on them hoes
Oww!

Cr-Cr-Crack, Crack, Crack, Crack, Crack, you hear the echo
Man I seen the best go, cause he ain't had that metal
I'm a hustler hustler, a pusher's pusher
You a buster, a customer, I get you some cook up
Yeah Crack is a chemist, I pack an eleven
I'm mackin' the seven, I'll clap at your reverend
I see you in N-Y, I'll send you an invite
You gon' need you a pass, that's the code that we live by

Now why's everybody so mad at the South for?
Change your style up, switch to southpaw
Jada, I was listenin'
So I made 'em a anthem to make some dividends
Lil' mama tryna hit me with that shoulder lean
This cut co Crack and I control the team
Couple bricks stacked on that triple beam
My dirty bro sippin' that promethazine
That ganja green, that Cali weed
A nigga lose his life tryna roll on me
Now, yup yup, we get it, no if ands about it
And the rain keep fallin', even when it's droughted
Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror
Got a hand full of stacks, better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I'm in this bitch with the Terror
Got a handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I make it rain on them hoes
Oww!

Mami's body's bangin', she got it, man she does it all
She gets it poppin' with no hands, I make it pour
I make it rain on 'em, I'm layin' game to 'em
I got some misses to tattoo my name on 'em
Gotta get that baby love, gotta get my paper up
Gotta stay strapped ASAP
'Case y'alls hate Crack and wanna rain on us
And you know what it is, yeah it's them powder kids
And we know how to bid, so we don't give a shit

Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the Terror
Got a hand full of stacks, better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I'm in this bitch with the Terror
Got a handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain (oh!) I make it rain on them hoes
