We The Best Music!
How many times the merry-go-round goes around
You come around a whole lot of times
DJ Khaled!

Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn, it feel great
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist

I might bust that little bitch, pass to my buddy (bust it, what?)
Bust it, beat it, pass her to my buddy (bust it, huh!)
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn, I feel great (yeah!)
Bust that little bitch, pass her to my buddy (straight up!)

Gin and tonic, pass that to my buddies (to my buddies!)
Only lean and soda, I'm not no alcoholic (alcoholic!)
How does that feel, my nigga? I said it feel great (woo, woo!)
Come bust a trip and come and be my tourist (straight up!)
Alligator swamp, we pill-pop in my hood (woo!)
Ain't no changin' that, cut that check, we all good (straight up!)
9 a.m. clockin', 4 a.m. water whippin'
Just got to the Mo, while niggas still leanin', tippin'
Had to bust a bitch I knew back from my old days
Shawty held me down when a nigga had that bald fade (straight up!)
504, my nigga, shout my woadie
La Flame killin' you niggas, damn, I'm sorry (damn, I'm sorry!)
That's not my kid, call up my nigga Maury (call up Maury!)
Drinkin', drivin', but I wore a condom, man
I'm stickin' to that story (damn, damn!)
I bust a nut like I bust a brick
Bust a band like I bust a kid
Bust a nigga like I bust a bitch
But I pass it like I'm Robert Horry (straight up!)

Ahem
Wayne's world, party time, excellent
She might be a tourist or a terrorist
A Hell's Angel actin' like she heaven-sent, Lord
We can go sight seein' and all that
She can be wifey and all that
She's the tourist, I'm her tour guide
Cause he just bullshit, I hit bullseye
The weed got her lightheaded, red eyes
I told her, "Don't worry, we stay high"
Plus there's a bed on my tour bus
So you can get fucked as we pull out, Lord
I pull out like skrrt in New Orleans
I pull up her skirt and get gnarly
She come to Wayne's world just to party
And all of my tourists is foreign
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (woo!)
(Bust a trip, come and be my tour—!)
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
(Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my for—!)
How does it feel, my nigga? (How does it feel?)
Damn, it feel great (damn, it feel great!) (straight up!)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (ayy!) (straight up!)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (woo!)
(Bust a trip, come and be my tour—!)
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
(Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my for—!)
How does it feel, my nigga? (How does it feel?)
Damn, it feel great (damn, it feel great!)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up!)
