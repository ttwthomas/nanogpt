70 ContributorsMurda Lyrics
Starting, why?
Why?
Why?
Yeah

First degree murder
Beg them nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner

Uh, real niggas say soowoo
And such and such killed such and such
The streets talk and bullshit walks on crutches, but
It's strut to strut
Niggas panic
Button pressing
The end is coming
Count your blessings
We living in the day and time
Where the ten commandments
Are now suggestions
How depressing
How infested
Click-clack, pow, intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses with tight pussies
I found the crevice
AK bullets move mountains
Break them bitches down to pebbles
That tough talk is like music to my ears
So keep it a capella
Based on a true story
We not worried, y'all too worried
I faced my fears and told them motherfuckers y'all too gorgeous
Dread head from New Orleans
Where the youth, them got two choices
Shoot, or get shot, or a nigga choose for you
We murdered them
You might also like
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

Yo, Tune point and I'm dusting niggas
I ain't talking lacing no marijuana
Soon as I hatched, I reigned like a quail
And gave two fucks, I ain't a koala
My uncle gangsta, but I make him nervous
All he see in my face is murder
Waste a burner is my waste a furnace
I pace and turn and she'll face the thermos
First birthday wish was getting caked up
Shoot a nigga, wake up on the wake-up
Lay down in a model bitch A-cup
Then I put pearls in a bitch like Jacob
Play tough, tape off of this tape-up
Race off like some motherfuckin' makeup
Take off, looking for something to take up
Get the paper or you goin' in the paper?
Not horoscopes, but in the horror scope
Pray to God you see tomorrow, nope
They gave my nigga thirty for a jar of dope
But do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap
Blowing so much, you sneezing dick
Believe in me, I don't believe in shit
Y'all pinching pennies? I'm squeezing drip
It's Young Money 'til I'm in the freezer stiff, bitch
First degree murder
Beg them nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

It's all about the money, nigga, fuck the fame
Where we come from, shots ring, nigga, broad day
Lil' woadie said he had a chance, he'd do this shit again
Poppin' pills for the pain, but still won't feel a thing
It's deeper than this rap, I'm in the back soaking game
Cartier frames got 'em looking at me strange
Why pre mostly heard and I'm rarely sane
Low-key can still get a brick off my name
Now I'ma tell you this here for my youngin 'nem
The same ones I hung the corners with, do numbers with
If it ever was a problem, watch 'em pull up quick
Caught an L sticking to the script, you know I switched
We now switch

First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner
Starting, why?
Why?
Why?
