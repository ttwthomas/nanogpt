Now, I was bouncing through the club
She love the way I Diddy-bop
I see her boyfriend hatin' like a city cop
Now, I ain't never been a chicken but my fifty cocked
Say, I ain't never been a chicken, but my semi cocked
Now, where your bar at? I'm tryna rent it out
And we so 'bout it-'bout it, now what are you about?
DJ show me love, he say my name when the music stop
"Young Money, Lil Wayne," then the music drop
I make it snow, I make it flurry
I make it all back tomorrow, don't worry
Yeah, young Wayne on them hoes
A.K.A Mr. Make-It-Rain-On-Them-Hoes—Young Money!

Bring an umbrella, please bring an umbrella

Bitch ain't shit but a ho and a trick
But you know it ain't trickin' if you got it
You know we ain't fuckin' if you not thick
And I'll cool your ass down if you think you hot shit
So Rolex-watch this: I do it, four-five-six
My click-clack goes the black four-fifth
And just like it, I'll blow that shit
'Cause, bitch, I'm the bomb, like "Tick, tick," biatch!
