Collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you do your crime
Well you made your bed, I'm in mine

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world to the world
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine

Yeah! Wayne's world
Planet Rock, panties drop
And the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock) and Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock) and Amanda and Tamara
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can fuck you up, I can fuck you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy
You might also like
Just let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
I'm back like I forgot something, I'm something
Rollin' Rock rubbing rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder
I wish I could be, as cruel as you
And I wish I could say, the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie, no not this time1Embed
