4 ContributorsParadise Lyrics
 on my island, smiling, geting higher than a rock star (star star)
Paparazzi watch me  take a dip into the water (ta)
Welcome to paradise (Welcome) Paradise, Paradise
Welcome to paradise (Let's get high) Paradise(Let's get high), Paradise (Let's get high high high)

Nigga I'm getting high as I wanna be whole different time zone
Destination paradise white  dimes on
All white suited like, Tony got my mind gone
Table full of (whoo) rolled on  til my mind gone
 proud of the sour baby I guess my Marley on
Life of the night like Snoop and $hort I keep the party gon'
Blood shot, cartiers cover my eyes
Oh don't you know I smoke that la la la la
Get fry, 360 fizzi
It help me get by
It got that bomb
Wish your vice got every kind
You'd be blind like a rock star
Leang off that pro-meth
Welcome to the methazine
Paradise, oh yes

You might also like
Welcome to Wayne's world
Party time ecstasy
Higher than a bitch
See Young Chris flying next to me
Don't know where i'm going
No sense of directory
Smokin on that shit
You can't produce hysterectomy
Lecture about my high don't wanna hear it
Tell me bout the end i might be near it
But who's to say who's the nearest
You might be listening to the spirits
And yeah i might be trippin
But i feels terrific
High feels terrific
And you know me
Mister soon to O.D
Off Mo-ney or Mo-Me, motherfucker
I am the ultimate high
High til i walk up to the pulpit and fly


I'm talking Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morris and Keith Richards
Erick Turner i'm talking Whitney Bobby addiction
Amy Whinehouse, Franie Lym and Lim-Bi
It's like Styles-P I blow my mind out
Smoke more than Snoop take it higher then Weezy and BG
Mayer buried till i'm buried like my nigga PC
Rest in peace to  Pimp, Heath Ledger, DJ Screw
John Bonham and the rest up in heaven
Still smoking chronic, still waiting for Detox
Fuck in my P.O. so she care less if my pee hot
Fuckin her right after the  are right
After i'm done she can sit back watch me get high, high high
