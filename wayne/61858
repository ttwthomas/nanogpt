23 ContributorsYao Ming Lyrics
Hello it’s Mr. David Banner, yo’ bitch beater
I suggest that you don’t kiss or hug her, and don’t eat her
I Run DMC’s in this bitch in my Adidas
I was chosen to expose who you chose as a leader
Yes, I’m fresh like a rose picked from the garden of Eden
I stepped out the Rolls, my game rose like Easter
I got a couple bitches that’s painted like Mona Lisa
I fuck ‘em at my leisure and I never touch my Visa
So ghetto, my kicks so retro
Got nuts like a rhino, call them Mark Ecko
You know I ain’t braggin’, pssh, I’m just sayin’
I know y’all said it too, 'cause y’all niggas playin’
David, David Banner, bitch

And bitch, I’m tall as Yao Ming
And bitch, I’m tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy, Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy (yeah, 2 Chainz!)

Let's make a toast to the breadwinner (yeah)
I am so damn hot, I done scared the Winter
Life a beach, I done danced with her, all up in the sand with her
Try to get up in the bed with her and put my third leg in her
Uh, I’ve been pumpin’ pussy like gas nigga (uh, gas)
Got my .44, you’ll get 8 like math, nigga (math)
Still use a shoe box for my stash, nigga
Money so tall, you gon’ need a giraffe with ya
Yeah, self-esteem high like 26 (yeah, tell 'em)
You can catch me gettin’ high with like 20 bitches (damn)
Takin’ plenty pictures, yeah you know I’m camera ready (true)
I’m about to wax that ass, I got my candle ready
You might also like
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch, I’m tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch, I’m tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy

Okay, traffic on Mars, smokin’ in a spaceship
Bright red flag stickin’ out like fake lips
I’m forever young, forever Young Mula
Bitch, Cash Money is a army, hoorah
Tunechi be what they call me, I’m everythin' but sorry
Get a bad-ass high yellow bitch to come and ride my horse
I named it Charlie
No cream in my coffee, don’t bleed on my carpet
I falls in love with all these hoes
But it’s money over bitches regardless
I’m so high, I won’t come down, boy, my pack be dumb loud
Waitin' for one of these niggas to cross the line like a touchdown
I gotchu, I’m Piru, bitch, I’m out that Bayou
Blade on the AK, cut your ass like high school
David Banner on the beat, bitch, dig it like a deep ditch
I got the world in my hands, I’m 'bout to make a fist
Ha, I stand tall as Yao Ming
Blocka pow-pow ping, must be New Orleans
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch, I’m tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch, I’m tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy1Embed
