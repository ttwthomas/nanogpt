8 ContributorsBlow My Mind Lyrics
Thats what they saying when the play me and they hear me on the radio
Thats what they saying to me x3

When the remy's in the system, ain't no telling, will i fuck or will i diss em
Thats what they be yelling
Im a pimp by blood, not relation, ya'll be chasin and i replace em
You dont need me for nothing else my nigga

When the remy's in the system
Ain't no telling on the spot where ima kiss em
Thats why they be yelling
Im a damu blood, my relation, affiliation, soo woo nation
And since day one ive looked forward to 3, 4, 5 bitches in my porsche coupe
Yeah i be on that ass like a horses shoe
And if her religion is true we bout to visit the moon
Is you coming?

Thats what they saying when the play me and they hear me on the radio
Thats what they saying to me
Thats what they saying to me
Thats what they telling me
You might also like
When the remy's in the system
Ain't no question ima fuck em and diss em
Leave em never missing1Embed
