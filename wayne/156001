You know, what's poppin homeboy?
(Aye Millz, what it look like baby)
You already know. Haha, A C
(Ha Ha)
Most hated(Ha)
Most hated(Ha)
Its the remix!

Tell the DJ to heel up, reel up, bring it back, come rewind
(Niggas ain't gone have no mo' bitches after this one)
Heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
Heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
Throw it out ma, work ya lower back and ya spine

Bring it back (AYE!), bring it back
I said bring it back (AYE!), bring it back, bring it back (AYE!)
I said momma heel up, reel up, bring it back come rewind
Throw it out, ma work ya lower back and ya spine

Heel up, reel up, bring it back come rewind
When it come to mine they be like, Buffy from behind
In the summertime it's like the top, didn't come wit mine
If ima dine, won't be Mickie D's number nine
Ya Seen 
Wit a mean blond, eatin green cause a chow
Somethin clean on, see bling on from a mile
Pair of jeans on neva seen on canal, baby girl I do my thang
I swing it back, bring it back, like a boomerang
It's click clack and kick back when the rooger bang
My chick in pepper, Gucci slipper stepper
Philly spot baggin buddie out wagon
Broad name Jadera, hard to get near her
She can make a "careera", shakin Like Shakira
Arch in her Back Bone, like throwin back trone
Even if she take it there, she gone bring it back home
You might also like

As the sun rotates and my account gets bigger
How many divas wanna slide with this nigga: Name Millz!
(One Of What!) The New Mayor Of Harlem
Bring it back, one mo' time, the remix is a problem
Say the convo Im tryin to bring it home
And I still got my Glock and a bottle of Patron
New blue Yankee, Issey Miyake cologne
Rich young hoodie, yellow gold white stones
I pop some of America's Top Bottles
And play the Top Clubs wit American's Top Models
And you know I Keep 'em puffin the La
I call It The Canievel they inhalin think they touchin the sky
Tell me who you know seein him my Air Ones premium
Some more less, won't see to many others, but me and them
And yeah I bagged a groupie one, from the video
But really though, she ain't comin if she ain't runnin the pussy so


Monster music I'm a monster baby
Fresher than the Johnson, and Johnson baby
Weezy Baby, 80's baby
Back when heroin was crazy baby (bring it back)
And they tell me im dope
You should pose mothafucka cuz I got you on scope
Ice everywhere momma we can hit the slopes
You can get on that mic if, you can hit the notes (bring it back)
By the way I gotta say
I got, hoes on me like I sprayed tag body spray
And shit on yo head now they call you potty face
Put the barrel to ya mouth say it to the shotty face(bring it back)
Now whatcha gotta say
And I make 'em bring it back like a replay
And I make her run it back like a relay
Im fly, you guys, delay (Bring It Back)
