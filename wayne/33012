6 ContributorsWhy U Treat Me So Cold Lyrics
Why you treat me cold, cold, cold, cold?
Why you do me wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?
I was doin' what I had to do
And what I did was for me and you

Girl, you know I did my time
All I had was you on my mind
Two years is a long time
I nearly almost lost my mind
Counted every day that went by
Couldn't wait to see the look in your eye
All I thought about was loving you
See a man had to do what a man had to do

Why you treat me cold, cold, cold, cold?
Why you do me wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?
I was doin' what I had to do
And what I did was for me and you
Why you treat me cold, cold, cold, cold?
Why you do me wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?
I was doin' what I had to do
And what I did was for me and you

Girl, don't you know that things got hard
I could not stand bein' apart
Questioned whether your love was true
Was somebody else loving you?
Now I'm knockin' at your door
You tellin' me you don't want me no more
What the hell am I to do?
See a man had to do what a man had to do

Why you treat me cold, cold, cold, cold?
Why you do me wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?
I was doin' what I had to do
And what I did was for me and you
Why you treat me cold, cold, cold, cold?
Why you do me wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?
I was doin' what I had to do
And what I did was for me and you
Why you treat me cold, cold, cold, cold?
Why you do me wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?
I was doin' what I had to do
And what I did was for me and you

Girl, can't you see what you're doin' to me?
Is this the way you want things to be?
Gave you everything that I have
You treat me so cold, you treat me so bad
Girl, can't you see you're killin' me?
Is this the way you want things to be?
My mind is so damn confused
Tell me what am I to do?
I was on the grind movin' bricks, you was tryin' to bring me back
To nickels and dimes, you had to quit, I was servin' it
Ready to ride or die behind my partner
Ready to slang that nine at any time 'cause I'm a rider
Nigga know, Lil' Wayne
Get down and dirty for this cheddar
And for me to let a broad interfere, nigga never
I was taught better than that
Slim and Baby gave me the ropes, and Rabbit taught me the game
And if you think I'm gon' let go, then you can catch up with your thang
It ain't gon' happen

Why you treat me cold, cold, cold, cold?
Why you do me wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?
I was doin' what I had to do
And what I did was for me and you
Why you treat me cold, cold, cold, cold?
Why you do me wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong?
I was doin' what I had to do
And what I did was for me and youEmbed
