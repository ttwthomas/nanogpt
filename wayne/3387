85 ContributorsWelcome to My Hood Lyrics
DJ Khaled!
Cash Money, Young Money, We the Best
Khaled, I got you!
Welcome to my hood, hee
Where the hood at? (Huh)
Where the hood at? (Uh-huh)
YMCMB (Rozay!)

Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school Chevys
24′s so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood, they outside playing hopscotch
And everybody know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on your knees
(Woop, woop) That's the sound of the police
In my hood

Audemar on my wrist, diamonds look like they glowing
50 stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin'
Treat them like jack boys, catch them slipping then slay them
Lord, forgive me for my sins
That's my confessions, if they put me in this Benz
I got possession of a federal offense
I'm talking pressure in my criminal intent (Huh)
So wear ya vests and I'm still gon' stunt like it ain't no tomorrow
Fuck ya house note, nigga, blow that bitch on a bottle
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back (Rozay)
Tell you “We The Best forever", DJ Khaled handle that (Huh)

Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school Chevys
24′s so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood, they outside playing hopscotch
And everybody know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on your knees
(Woop, woop) That's the sound of the police
In my hood

I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Noriega
I’m talkin’ Noriega, nigga, the real Noriega
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us
And tell Congress when you see 'em, bitch, I'm stealin' cable
And leave the D-Boys alone cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers?
Some are on house arrest, some are on child support
Some of them did they bid, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr. Landlord, we gon' bust your ass with an eviction note
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo
I'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores
We throw our money round here, but y'all can't call us broke

Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school Chevys
24′s so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood, they outside playing hopscotch
And everybody know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on your knees
(Woop, woop) That's the sound of the police
In my hood
Bitch, I’m on probation, so my nerves bad
And they say time flies, well mine’s first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell 23
Tell the warden kiss my ass, pockets on Monique
Bitch I’m from the murder capital, ho, I’m far from practical
Shit happens and since I’m the shit, I’m who it happens to
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I’m red hot
I don’t see nobody, see no body like a head shot
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out
Got it sewn up, check the thread count
(Young Mula baby, YMCMB, Khaled I gotcha!)

Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody (Ugh)
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school Chevys
24′s so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood, they outside playing hopscotch
And everybody know this is the hot spot (Mama, I got em')
Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on your knees
Woop, woop (I say fuck the) police
