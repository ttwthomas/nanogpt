25 ContributorsDon’t Touch Me (Throw Da Water On ’Em) (Remix) Lyrics
This is a national security alert (Remix. Remix. Remix.)
Ground Music. Flip mode. Aftermath. Here we go. (Remix Remix. Remix.)

Real talk word to mother it be the gutter brother (ah!)
Back with another banger to set off the summer (huh!)
Better get up and come a-round
Cause the way our shit will be cloggin up the toilet
You probably should call the plumber
You niggas get dumb and dumber
Thinkin you can come around and test me
Like these other niggas, well, pick a number
I''m sayin you should never ever think that you better nigga
Get it together, been bodyin shit since mommy named me Trevor
Stellar the way I give a hell of a performance and get a
Reaction I attract all the people to come together
Whether niggas realize it or not oppose a letter
Just let a fella think what it wouldn't make him rememeber that
When I'm in the buildin it's cool for you to rest in
Remember I'm too hot to touch kid
Curious, my fire burnin niggas serious
I gift wrapped the flame and give it to niggas, here it is
See through motherfuckers, we'll never be equal
I'll banish and make 'em vanish and do it for (the people)
I be the baddest see when I spit I become the maddest
And kill 'em until the blood'll (seep through)
Front if you want but you know who the top biller
Bounce while I'm killing the strut and walk with a bop, killer!

So don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
Here we go

R-double E-K, D-A Villian
I'll pull a grip out of this waist and splatter ya face
When the cali' blow, you'll get a face shot like a cameo
Rob the man and leave his ass naked like he D'Angelo
Bet I'll let a pistol dismiss you if it's a issue
Of a tissue that money'll get you clapped quick (come on)
Turn a wimp past wittle to a gym class hero
When my AR13'll make 'em backflip (come on)

I'm a BK felon I'll run you down with a weapon
My goonies get looney anytime that I tell 'em
Dead 'em, I walk around with stacks in my denim
With fast foreign cars with the gator skin in 'em
Now I got pretty women all around the world
If I been in your city probably pound your girl
Had her stretched out swimmin in the pool with her breast out
Send her back home set to fire the sex out
So don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
Here we go

Motherfucker, it's FLIPMODE, when I come up in the club
Throwin up a dub, liftin up a snub
Flipmode be stars, you know who the fuck we are
Used to be fishscales, now we fuck with caviar
Eatin on supreme shit, at the round table
On some cream shit, like I grew up in Queensbridge
I talk reckless, the whole world know
My style is C4 and I'm ABOUT TO BLOW
So don't get close, we'll touch ya ribs
And come bust lil' brother with the stick-up kids
Like, "Shh, take off the watch"
"Shh, take off the watch"
"Shh, take off the watch"
They said Game in the club with a big ass Glock
Like boom, guess who stepped in the room
LAX comin' through JFK real soon

So don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
Here we go
Jump on the track like Michael Jeffrey
Even the referee say I need an ESPY
Award just applaud I'm a boar with a broad
I go hard and my leather so soft and I cough
And the board of health say the boy need help
I am so hot the AM just melt
All aboard, all aboard black card, no fraud
I'm an extension cord, I'm a lightning rod
I'm a lion roar, I'm a dinosaur
I'm a sinus minus the nose, I'm a cold
I'm raw than a temperature rose to five and
Two o's that's 500 degrees for those who know
My fire's higher than a liars
We don't burn rubber, we burn tires
We riders, residers, we live in The Carter
Wayne is a flame that could live in the water
Ok now let's get it straight, either you bait or the mate
Either way you on my plate gettin ate after grace
If you taste like base, snares and tenors be my dinner
I'm hotter in the winter, burn like sinners, turn like spinners
I swear I'll put ya in the urn by your picture
Boy we ain't playin Weezy baby, he the man
Hotter than the Peter pan to a wet bare hand

So don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
Here we go

Man, listen I spot a square dude from a distance
Through the tinted Maybach curtain in partition
Nip/Tuck niggas, I could never fuck with 'em
Or pass the blunt with 'em, let the guns hit 'em
Bring fire, frizzy hair for press-spire
You ain't a rider, pa'tna I'm a crippler
Crutch giver, hospitalizer, hottest whip driver
Keep on my hip, the biggest life or death decider
I ain't a rapper or an activist, I'm badder
I used to run from a cracker named Lieutenant Casper
No black leather jackets or black berets
Since my old days, like I stepped from a Vogue page
And none of y'all cop what I cop
Forget your excuse if the music ain't hot
Where the Range? Where the drops? Y'all never got hoes
See you on the club, wrist never on froze

So don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
Here we go

Busta Bus pick me up in the Coupe to come bubble through
This is routine kid it ain't nothin new
You bring trouble to me, the untouchable
Make me have to bring in the troops like George W
I'll scorch you somethin awful when I fall through
Of course the raw to be when you could put a broad to
Better bring with you your fire extinguisher
Listen, I love static and I'm ready to cling to ya (OK!)
Kid I made it from magazine pages to big stages
High wages through all of the different ages
Thinkin you do it like this is outrageous
Yeah I'm sick with it but it's not contageous
Your hottest thing to me, not a thing
Every night my crib is like the Bada Bing
So make sure that you youngin's got it right
Kane's who's the fuckin rockstars party like, you heard?

So don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
Here we go1Embed
