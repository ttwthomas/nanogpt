2 ContributorsSu Woo LyricsPardon my gang affil
But you're stepping on a rod in the danger field
Weezy Baby, how do the Manger feel?
Respect my aim because I aim to kill
Hahaha, Old bitch ass nigga
Abercrombie and Fitch ass nigga
I talk rich shit because I'm a rich ass nigga
I hope you in the zone because I pitch fast nigga
Ha, I smoke something bitch
My money comes faster than the roadrunner bitch
I keep it on the side just in case you might wonder
Tec 9 Four 5 just in case you like numbers
Haha, bitch nigga we might jump ya
2 Step all in yo face, we might Unk ya
Hahaha, bandana on the right side
East side until I die
You better change like it's Mardi Gras
And we pull guns like Quick Draw McGraw
See I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana
And he's from Compton, baby, bandana
We carry them caskets, we tote them hammers
Su to the Woop, yeah, that's our grammar
Lemme hear you say Su Woop
Su Woop, Su WoopYou might also likeEmbed
