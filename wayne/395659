2 ContributorsNoting Lyrics
Niggas be hatin but the ain't sayin noting
I ll be rappin all day
All ma niggas wanna stay
And them girls wanna play
Girl cnt u see im rapping
Get off the way
And she goes screamin
U ain t sayin nothing
That bitch is dam
She understands nothing
But five minutes later she be clapping
All ma niggas laufing
Everybody wants to  spend the knight
But i can't rap all knight
So go home allright
I ll be on ma way
Because I ain't sayin notin
But im not hatin
Wanna be like me
Came en chill with me
Maybe u will get to know me
Because u never see me
It don t mean u do not know me
Nigga don t play with me
Beause ain't sayin notinYou might also likeEmbed
