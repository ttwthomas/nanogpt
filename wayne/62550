12 ContributorsI Get It In (Original Version) Lyrics
I done cut the braids low
Cut got my grown on
Had to switch the label Young Money
Money long-long
I be so L.A., got my Chucks and my Locs on
I was in MIA and MIA superman on

I know I got it (uh), I know she on it (uh)
I know you see it (uh), I know she want it
She got that Cali good, and she kinda hood
She got me policin’ and wishin’ that a nigga would
Cause lil mama got her back right
She be skating on it, got a nigga seeing flashlight
He trying to get her but she be holding on hella tight
I got that act right, that’s what she like

I get it in (I get it in), I get it in (I get it in)
I get it in (I get it in), I get again and again
I get it in (I get it in), I get it in (I get it in)
I get it in (I get it in), I get again and again

Stuntin’ with them boys
Cause she done found a man now
Ain’t no competition chief I’m the one that hangs down
I’ma show her love-love even when my fans ride
G-g-get into the music baby tell me how my bang sound
You might also like
I know I got it (uh), I know she on it (uh)
I know you see it (uh), I know she want it
She got that Cali good, and she kinda hood
She got me policin’ and wishin’ that a nigga would
Cause lil mama got her back right
She be skating on it, got a nigga seeing flashlight
He trying to get her but she be holding on hella tight
I got that act right, that’s what she like

I get it in (I get it in), I get it in (I get it in)
I get it in (I get it in), I get again and again
I get it in (I get it in), I get it in (I get it in)
I get it in (I get it in), I get again and again

Fresh out my Bugatti, Polo on my body
I’m jumpin’ in this shit like a pogo on a potty
So she come and talk to me like K-Ci, JoJo, and Devante
I say hi my name is Weezy and I know you know Omarion
Haha, I get it in like parking spots
And they say money talk, so don’t ask me why I talk a lot
Girl I’ll kiss your softest spot, I’ll buy your apartment out
Actually I just bought a house, I get it in and walk ‘em out
I done got the dreads braided up, hair long-long
And I’m with a redbone, that don’t want leave her thong on
It’s too big, it’s too wide, it won't fit
But I get it in
I get it in (I get it in), I get it in (I get it in)
I get it in (I get it in), I get again and again
I get it in (I get it in), I get it in (I get it in)
I get it in (I get it in), I get again and again

Hey! Omarion. Hey!1Embed
