I'm on that fuckin' Patrón
I'm on that fuckin' Patrón
And I like it, I feel like fightin'
Yeah, shit
Check me out

Okay, I know this ain't The Matrix, but I'm feelin' like the one right now
And to them boys that's trippin', please keep trippin'
Keep it up and it's about to go down
I told 'em don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
Everybody got guns, won't be no fists
Now I'm trippin' on Cohiba, now all y'all funny
If you sick, get an Ibuprofen
But I be gettin' money

Hey, I'm on that fuckin' Patrón
And I like it, I feel like fightin'
Feel like fuckin'
Feel I might just get her to the crib and put her into a crisis
Fresh from my hat to the bottom of my Nikes
Fresh from my hat to the bottom of my Nikes
I won't deny it
I won't deny it
I won't deny it
I'm a fuckin' rider
And I'm gettin money
You might also like
Yeah, so now we strip club hoppin'
Got the pills in the club, got the strip club poppin'
And I be throwin' money till the strip club stoppin'
And yeah hoe what it do, but the bitch goin' shoppin'
She bought herself some clothes and she brought me back a chopper
She-she bought herself some clothes and she brought me back a chopper
See bitches trynna kick it but no, I don't play soccer
I'm all about my cake, I'm trynna marry Betty Crocker
'Cause I be gettin' moneyEmbed
