Big reefer cloud got it storming inside (Drizzlin')
Foreign outside, I'm usually foreign when I drive (Speedin')

We at the strip joint blowing money on the bitches (Let it rain)
We standin' on the bar throwing money like a pitcher (We get money)
But, nigga, I ain't slippin', got a fully-loaded trigger
And that can cause a heatwave (Get you clapped)
