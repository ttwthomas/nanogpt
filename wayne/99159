11 ContributorsDo My Thang Lyrics
Well, alright, I can't feel my face, I'm going first

And my grill is ill
Ice bright white like Jaleel
Did I do that?
Throwing up signs, like I'm in a frat
Eagle Street, bitch
See me when you want to, find me, I'm the owner
Them yellow diamonds looking like a fridge full of Coronas
Own us, you see through like cubic zirconias
And me I keep it funky like pubic aroma
Hit em' with the Glock
Put em' in a coma
Now what that boy got? Umm, glaucoma (Haha)
My weed is stronger, I smell great
I like promethezine, I'm in a snail race
And my watch reminds me of '88
Because I got crack rocks in the watch face
Bitches stick to me like scotch tape
Plenty colors in da chain nigga fuck Bape
Yea, bitch I'm cold like up-state
So icy like a motherfuckin' cupcake
Ya, these hoes feel my feng shui
And wanna eat me alive I'm like an entrée
You might also like
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
I does my motherfuckin' thing
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
I does my motherfuckin' thing, ya dig

Santana bandana on tilt
Back seat with the heat, I'm warmer than a quilt
They lookin at me like they drink spoiled milk
Money tall: Jack and Jill
Like they sittin' on a hill
Ice on the neck of me, ice on the wrist of me
Ice in both hands bitch I'm lit like a Christmas tree
Different color stones you could call it a mystery
Big dookie rope, you would think they was lynchin' me
Chain on top of chain man I look like Mr. T
I pity the fool the day he try to get with me
Fresh Prince, got banks like Hilary
And I hit docks with the hickory dickory
I make the girls run fast like Benny Hill
Rims go round and round you can call them my Ferris wheels
Pockets full of bank rolls, money long as train smoke
And it come faster than a nigga fuckin' J-Lo
I don't play games I shoot it up like Halo
Got more paper than your job's got payroll
Still I'm ghetto like no frills
I clean the dirt out my nails 100 dollar bills
Cause
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
I does my motherfuckin' thing
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
I does my motherfuckin' thing, ya digEmbed
