What up, though?
Yeah, this is No Ceilings man, welcome
I appreciate you having this if you got this, or if you listening to this, thank you
First off, this is for you, you you you, as always
This is a big thank you for coming out to all the nights and days on tour, tours actually
For coming to support me every single night
Even if you didn't come to the tour, this is just a thank you
And um, that's that Guddaville playing in the background
My nigga Gudda mixtape go get that shit
And uh I ain't gonna talk too much
So, I'm gonna get back to this blunt
And you get back to the mixtape
No Ceilings!You might also likeEmbed
