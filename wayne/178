66 ContributorsD.O.A. Lyrics
La-da-da-da
Hey, hey, hey
Goodbye
Ugh, Fiji water, grandaddy purp
Excuse me, I let the semi-automatic burp
Blood gang, motherfucker, call me "Red Alert"
Young Carter kill in order, who get it first?
Stuff that girl with dick 'til her head burst
Young Weezle, flow needles, I could thread shirts
Boy, you ain’t did shit, I done said worse
Flip your fitted cap back like Fred Durst
Ugh, Fiji water, OG kush
Yeah, I drink verses and eat hooks
Got the stove on my waist, and we cooks
I'm in the way, you can’t pass, like Aaron Brooks
President, ride the car slow
I let my driver drive, I'm on Par 4
Spit hanging from my mouth, retard flow
And I say what I won like an award show
I'm on some shit ain’t even came out the ass yet
Sit back and watch the green grow like the grass wet
Young or old, there ain’t no comparing me
I just cleared that up, moment of clarity, ugh!
You might also like
La-da-da-da
Hey, hey, hey
Goodbye

Ugh, I'm about to go almonds
Young head-buster, get your helmets
You niggas real soft—what is that, velvet?
I get big chips, you get Alvins
Ugh, I'm about to go walnuts
We get seven-digit money, you could call us
Hit 'em with the chopper, watch 'em ball up
Paint your face red, you all dolled up
Yeah, Young Nino, nigga
Do it for my team, Tim Tebow, nigga
I'm killing this shit, Grim Reap' flow, nigga
Getting swallowed by the Maybach, deepthroat, nigga!
Ugh, I'm about to go Planters
I’m still in my prime, Deion Sanders
We all gamblers, I will not lose
Flow precious as diamonds, I drop jewels
Give me mine or I'ma take mine
Smoking purple, I heard it through the grapevine
Weezy Baby, AKA Your Highness
I just killed this shit, moment of silence, ugh!
La-da-da-da
Hey, hey, hey
Goodbye
Haha
But I ain't finished
Uh-uh
No Ceilings, motherfucker! Yeah

Ugh, I'm in the zone like a fastball
And I fuck the game up like a bad call
Let the money stack, don’t let the cash fall
Bars all day, no last call
Ugh, I'm in the Red Zone, nigga
Wake up in the morning with your head gone, nigga
Birdman Junior, wings spread on niggas
Leave the beef in the streets and bring the bread home, nigga
Yeah, tell the doctor, "Step aside, please"
Dr. Carter, gasoline in your IVs
Strong dry weed, make my eyes bleed
Strong-arm rap, I rock a iron sleeve
Ugh, I'm in the zone like the secondary
No lie, bitch, I’m flyer than a pet canary
I’m a dog on the beat, fuck the vet-inary
Two women praise me like Mary Mary
Ugh, I'm in the zone like college ball
Spit fire like I’m sipping on a Molotov
Loose bowels, this shit so easy
I might send this to the mixtape, Weezy (Ugh!)
Hahahaha
La-da-da-da
No Ceilings
Hey, hey, hey
Yeah
Goodbye
Haha!!20Embed
