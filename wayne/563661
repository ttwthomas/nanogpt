1 ContributorBET Awards 2008 Freestyle LyricsDidn't your momma tell you not to mess with them aliens?
I'm just trynna mate like a fuckin' Australian
Dreams of fuckin' Ms. Sarah Palin
And don't McCain look like his heart about to fail him?
But scratch that shit, Young Money, we the greatest
Add another check to my checkings and savings
Add four F's to the Weezy F. Baby
Now I'm Weezy Fuckin' Fuckin' Fuckin' Fuckin' Fuckin' BabyYou might also like1Embed
