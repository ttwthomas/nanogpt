18 ContributorsBye Bae Lyrics
Mic Check

Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the highway
Music playin', phone on vibrate
Hoody followin' me, that's my big dog
Just in case some shit kick off, I got my big dog
Wifey callin' me, I answer, "Hi bae"
I said, "I'm joogin right now," she said, "Ok, I'll pray"
"You know I hate talkin' and drivin' on the highway"
"I love you"
"I love you too"
"Okay, bye bae"

I'm goin' up, on a Sunday
I'm in L.I.V, here niggas with the "what" face
And all the niggas that I'm with, they bout that gun play
And all the bitches that I'm with ain't bout no foreplay
And all the niggas that I'm with, they in the drug trade
And all the chickens that we get, they come from Josè
A hundred dollars for a chopper, that's a throw away
Oh shit, lil mama she did swallow all my proteges
I'm on the highway to heaven, highway to heaven
Birds in the trunk, let 'em fly away to heaven
Highway to heaven, you just got a message
O-M-W, we gettin' off at your exit
I got
You might also like
Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the highway
My passenger is on parole and he can't violate
We watchin' out for all these snitches with that spygate
And all these thirsty bitches, I let 'em dehydrate
Yes Lord
Wifey callin' me, I answer, "Hi bae"
I said, "I'm joogin right now," she said, "Ok, I'll pray"
I said, "I'll be back soon, and call my goons if I'm late"
"I love you"
"I love you too"
"Okay, bye bae"

Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the freeway
Wifey just text a nigga, "Be safe"
Chain on my neck look like a King K
Bettin' a hundred K on Green Bay
Okay, I'm murderin' this motherfuckin' freeway
You can get murdered on the mornin' of your b-day
I pulled the  out this mornin', made the streets pay
My Benz and my Wraith startin' to feel betrayed
The feds stingin' like a motherfuckin' stingray
The money old, dead presidents startin' to decay
The money comin' right back, it's on replay
I'm bout to have some D'ussé with my filet
Yes Lord
Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the highway
Tunechi playin', phone on vibrate
Ya, Hoody followin' me, that's my big dog
Just in case some shit start, I got my big dog
Wifey callin' me, I answer, "Hi bae"
I said, "I'm joogin right now," she said, "Ok, I'll pray"
"You know I hate talkin' and drivin' on the highway"
"I love you"
"I love you too"
"Okay, bye bae"

I got Hoody followin' me, that's my big dog
Just in case it kick off, I got my big dog

The birds touchdown, bitch, I'm jumpin' on the highway
Comin' straight to ya, I've been waitin' for like five days
*Like five days*
I'm HoodyBaby, you can call me crazy
*Call me crazy*
I treat my plug just like Sanaa Lathan
Love, I gotta ball, move the work in Ferraris
Nothin' in my trunk, police officer, I'm sorry
Haha
Today was a good day
*Why?*
I got a hood full of good yay
Now I'm in the hood, with a hood full of good yay
Meetings in my mansion just the villas in the 
Gotta plug on white yay, I can get you ten yay
For the right price, I can even get you Kanye
*I got*
Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the highway
Ya, invisible as fuck, I'm in the Hyundai
Ya, the chick I'm with, her trunk look like Beyonce's
If she stay down, she gon' be pickin' up some bridesmaids
Yes Lord
Hit it to the  and get her my way
Lord knows when I open this trunk them thing gon' fly away
Wifey know I hate talkin' and drivin' on the highway
"I love you"
"I love you too"
"Okay, bye bae"

Highway to heaven, highway to heaven
Birds in the trunk, we let 'em fly away to heaven
Highway to heaven, highway to heaven
Birds in the trunk, we let 'em fly away to heaven
Got some birds in the trunk, and we drive to wherever
O-M-W, we gettin' off at your exit
I got

Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the highway
I got Jeezy playin', phone on vibrate
Ya,  with me, that my big dog
Just in case some shit kick off, I got my big dog
Wifey callin' me, I answer, "Hi bae"
I say, "I'm joogin right now," she say, "Ok, I'll pray"
"You know I gotta pay attention on this highway"
"I love you"
"I love you too"
"Okay, bye bae"
