2 ContributorsHold You Lyrics
Girl I'll hold you down yeah
I seen you and I was like
Got you in my sight don’t try no games with me
Gotta keep it straight when you come around

Im finding everyday you teach me something new
Girl you know Im never ever gonna be done with you
We never really ones to take the basic route
Life is all a game I guess we gotta play it through
Bumping Wu-Tang Eating Poutine
Nothing but a G thing
In my G Lane
She a bad thing
With a good heart let her soul sing
Never so so
Never solo always rolling

Hit me late at night yeah Im about to roll through
When Im all alone I just wanna hold you
Talk to me just don't give me that look
I won't leave even if I ever could
Hit me late at night yeah Im about to roll through
When Im all alone I just wanna hold you
Talk to me just don’t give me that look
I won't leave even if I ever could
You might also like
Them things still knowing what they going for
Im heavy in a couple cities don't tell the informers
Chevy 16 inches ten switches
Drop top old school hold ten bitches
Fold em riches get both of them digits
No nare nigga compare to young
Nuts hung low ho prepare your tongue
Yeah the game been hurting Im the medicine ahead of them
I ain't this worked at the rest of them
Mother fuck em Im the boy on fire like corduroy
Rubbing together I get money forever
I got two clips taped together
Thats a hundred whenever
Loving the cheddar call me mozzarella
Its no sweat I could hustle in the hottest weather
Im Weezy fucking baby lots of terror
PS a few shots to whoever
Yeah

Hit me late at night yeah Im about to roll through
When Im all alone I just wanna hold you
Talk to me just don't give me that look
I won't leave even if I ever could
Hit me late at night yeah Im about to roll through
When Im all alone I just wanna hold you
Talk to me just don't give me that look
I won't leave even if I ever could

Thought we were free to love
Thought we were free to love
Girl you can count on me
Girl you can call on me
Yeah Yeah
Let me start describing you
Eyes so bright they gonna light the room
Love so strong baby I salute
You got me making plans for a life for two
Fly you out in France then I take you out in Cabo
Watch your favorite movies on the plane to Morocco
The whole world is a playground for the lost soul
Baby girl ain’t gon be nowhere we cannot go
Nowhere, Nowhere that we
Cannot go nowhere you see
Cannot go nowhere you see

Hit me late at night yeah Im about to roll through
When Im all alone I just wanna hold you
Talk to me just don’t give me that look
I won't leave even if I ever could
Hit me late at night yeah Im about to roll through
When Im all alone I just wanna hold you
Talk to me just don’t give me that look
I won't leave even if I ever couldEmbed
