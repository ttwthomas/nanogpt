2 ContributorsTeam (Clean) Lyrics
Iggs
Look

Turn me up, break the knob right
I get dressed like it's prom night
I feed them lemons in the limelight
They say I'm full, lost my appetite?!
(Hell nah) Keep on pushing like a dealer (say what?)
(Hell nah) Keep on shooting, Reggie Miller (say what?)
(Hell nah) Go and give 'em all the finger
You gotta set the score right, call it Hans Zimmer
My time wherever I go
I took a chance like I'm from Chicago
100+ in that Murcielago
Bout to go ape, hey! Turn it to the congo

Baby I got me, baby I got me
Yeah, that's all I need
Yeah, that's all I need
Baby I got me, only friend I need
Playing on my team is someone like
Me, baby, no way
Watch me while I do my thing
Oh, baby, no way
Are you rollin’ with the team?
You might also like
Outchea, pronto
Hit 'em with the dose, that's a combo
Running through ya block, no fumble
Bout to kill 'em all, where the shovel?
See I gotta go for mine
Benja-jammin', that money on my mind
Jamaican club, I'm stayin' on the grind
Dutty wine, don't step on this land mine
Ven aquí, ándele
You tryna take flight? Do what I say
100+ Vogues on the highway
Watch a new car dash, call me Kylie

Baby I got me, baby I got me
Yeah, that's all I need
Yeah, that's all I need
Baby I got me, only friend I need
Playing on my team is someone like
Me, baby, no way
Watch me while I do my thing
Oh, baby, no way
Are you rollin’ with the team?

Are you workin' with some cash here, cash here?
100,000 on the dash, yeah, dash, yeah
All my ladies shake it fast, yeah, fast, yeah
Now vogue on that a—, yup! Yeah we in here
Are you workin' with some cash here, cash here?
100,000 on the dash, yeah, dash, yeah
All my ladies shake it fast, yeah, fast, yeah
Now vogue on that a—, yup! Yeah we in here
Baby I got me, baby I got me
Yeah, that's all I need
Yeah, that's all I need
Baby I got me, only friend I need
Playing on my team is someone like
Me, baby, no way
Watch me while I do my thing
Oh, baby, no way
Are you rollin’ with the team?

Team, team
Team, team
Are you rollin' with the team?
Are you rollin' with the team?
Are you rollin' with the team?
Are you rollin' with the team?Embed
