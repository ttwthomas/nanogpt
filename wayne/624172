3 ContributorsGridin Remix Lyrics
 Workin' like I gotta' pay ten bills in one day
Nigga, Im' grindin'
All these diamonds on my neck, looking like a flashlight
Nigga im' shine'n
Tribe Mafia, they thought we was done, but we back call that shit perfect time'n
Don't hate. Please get the fuck out my face!
We don't respond to that shit when its fake
Your squad against my squad nigga that's a death date
So soft you try not to be
Your opinions don't really matter me
There's no fucking feelings involve
Nope, not no feelings involve
You might also likeOh you just mad cause she's missing your calls?
But she can't talk with my dick in her jaws
Pull that ass back, make her clap an applause
Surfboard this dick,call that shit a sea saw
Yes
She chasing me, cause' she's chasing the best
She don't want you, cause' you just like the rest
Basic. Predictable. Stress
Plus she likes them niggas from the west
Making money every day. while your ass is waiting on a check
Nigga i'm Grindin'!

Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Put time into all this shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I think I got it bitch
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
