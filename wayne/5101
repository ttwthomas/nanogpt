48 Contributors100 Million Lyrics
This for the hood (This for the hood)
This for the ghetto (This for the ghetto)
This is for them niggas getting that money (That money, brrr)
That cash money, that 100 million dollar money (That cash money)
Nigga we got money (Money)
We the best

Ridin' big, gettin' mine (Yeah, yeah)
Two microwaves, flip a brick at a time
Bandana on the handle, ready for the whip (Whip)
When I wear the whitest soft, watch it disappear (House)
I disappear in the middle of the night
When I reappear, bet the boss look so bright (So bright)
For life, dope boy (For life, dope boy)
More strikes, oh boy (More strikes)
We ridin' low, gettin' high
80 round drum let ya know the time
When you see the Maybach, niggas know it's mine
Ridin' on the 2-4's, I'm ahead of my time
Watch one of a kind, another one of 'em mine
Phone bill four grand, get your ho on my line
In the hood, ho niggas act funny
Only real niggas really get to touch cash money

I spent about 100 million dollars
100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (Ghetto)
And I came from the ghetto (Ghetto)
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto

Number one, niggas, shit
Everyday a new whip homie so you know I gets my shine on (Shine, shine)
Flip after we flip homie, so you know I gets my grind on (Gets my grind on, brr)
Birdman daddy, pullin' up in that brand new Caddy
Got money, livin' lavish, got bitches shipping package
Move them things, get them things, switch that lane
Get that change, flip them thangs, get yo' money homie, do your thang (Get your roll on)
See I got 'em like ten times, spend money, got it like ten times (Brr, brr)
Flip that, got 'em like ten times, got money like ten more times nigga (Brr)

I spent about 100 million dollars
100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (Ghetto)
And I came from the ghetto (Ghetto)
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm from the ghetto, the bottom, the hood, the slums (Slums)
There's money out here, we just trying to get some (Uh)
Cool like Dre nigga, A like K
When ya talk about me you better watch what ya say (Ooh)
Don't ever keep them things where ya lay
Cause them pussy ass niggas show the folks where ya stay
Ya thought he was ya dog, said he was a G (G)
Sounds like another co-defendant to me (Ha, ha)
Niggas moving sloppy and I really don't like it (Nah)
Fuck around and get everybody indicted
Saw this shit coming, you woulda thought I was a psychic
Fuck around and go dead broke trying to fight it

I, I, I all night it, I every day it
And when it comes to my dues, I overpaid it
Rated hood bitch, bitch I'm hood bitch (Bitch, bitch)
I ain't a asshole, but I'm on some hood shit
I wish I would switch, I don't know how
Blood Gang swarm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile
Like my grill didn't cost me a 100 thou

I spent about 100 million dollars
100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (Ghetto)
And I came from the ghetto (Ghetto)
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto, hold ya hood up
If ya ghetto
