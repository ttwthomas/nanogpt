Another day
Another night
And she’s acting like she don’t sleep
She’s a five when she drinks
But she’s a ten when she’s on top of me

She don’t want love
She just want to touch
She’s a greedy girl to never get enough
She don’t want love
She just want to touch
She’s got all the moves
To make you give it up
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You'll never be her only
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You'll never be her only
See Enrique Iglesias LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also likeYeah yeah yeah

It’s a game (ha!)
That she plays
She can win with her eyes closed
It’s insane
How she tames
She can turn you into an animal
Yeah yeah yeah

To make you give it up
Yeah yeah yeah

She never satisfied
You better do it right
Before you’re lonely
No she’s never satisfied
You better do it right
Before you’re lonely
Come on

Hello baby it’s Weezy baby
It’s going down, depreciating
Okay now I don’t dance unless we dancing dirty
Skinny leather pants, I’m on my Eddie Murphy
Shawty shake it fast like she in a hurry
I like the full glass, I like my Mary bloody
She is not doing you and you are not doing nothing
It is not no money like Young Money
