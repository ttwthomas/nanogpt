There's nothing wrong with getting a buzz going

And light up like a motherfucker hot
And light up when this motherfucker drops
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado
And light up, lock and motherfuckin' load
And light up, let this motherfucker glow
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado

And let me hit that before it goes out
Don't be so, so stingy (Just pass it on the left)
And let me hit that before it goes out
Ooh, like a motherfucker hot (Now everybody put one in the air)

Let's go, I did this one for the stone-heads
And the motherfuckers with the strong weed
Oh shit, my weed man's phone dead
See that's why I need to start growing my own weed
I'm like, "Oh my goodness, I don't smoke bullshit"
If you sober, don't judge me, leave it up to the jury
Smoke medicinal weed like I'm tryna cure shit
And I feel better than alligators with good skin
She roll my weed for me, hold my weed for me
She hold that shit, them other bitches got weak stomachs
I don't smoke hookah, I don't know the future
But last night was nuts, and it never got neutered
It go, "Smell it like you buy it, light it, hit it
Mix it with the hash, now we getting scientific
Psychedelic grass, I feel like the highest cricket
Just a pot-head, weed stinking like a pot to piss in," holla at me
You might also like
And light up like a motherfucker hot
And light up when this motherfucker drops
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado
And light up, lock and motherfuckin' load
And light up, let this motherfucker glow
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado

And let me hit that before it goes out
Don't be so, so stingy (Just pass it on the left)
And let me hit that before it goes out
Ooh, like a motherfucker hot (Now everybody put one in the air)

Okay, I'm smokin' strong, we smokin' strong
Living that pot head life, my nigga, my stove is on
I got them suicide doors, and they look like open arms
My nigga T in this bitch, I save all my rolls just for him
Okay, my pusher stay lowkey, my kush is a OG
I don't smoke regular like I don't eat whole wheat
I don't smoke mid neither, I got two bad bitches
Named Indica and Sativa, and we 'bout to have a threesome
Alright, I'ma need a light
My high coming down, I feel like I'm eating right
Marijuana should be legal, I'ma fight for equal rights
"I think I can, I think I can," got a nigga thinking twice
Coming straight from Cloud 9 like a lightning strike
Hit the blunt two times, then go nighty-night
She just want to open up, girl, hit this blunt and be you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do," yeah
And light up like a motherfucker hot
And light up when this motherfucker drops
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado
And light up, lock and motherfuckin' load
And light up, let this motherfucker glow
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado

And let me hit that before it goes out
Don't be so, so stingy (Just pass it on the left)
And let me hit that before it goes out
Ooh, like a motherfucker hot (Now everybody put one in the air)

I get my weed from the west, where the weed is the best
I take a hit and inhale and take the deepest of breaths
I'm a hippie, my nigga, I be like, "Peace and respect"
And be the same motherfucker that'll beat you to death, oh
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado (Alright)
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado (Woo)
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky (JT, holla at me back)
And light up like a motherfucker hot
And light up when this motherfucker drops
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado
And light up, lock and motherfuckin' load
And light up, let this motherfucker glow
Rocky, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Mountain, Mountain high, Colorado

And let me hit that before it goes out
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum... Bu-bu-bu-bu)
