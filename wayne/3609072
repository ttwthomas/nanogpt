Cut like a blender, chopper like the feegy
They got so many pussy nigggas, they starting to police me
I don't give a fuck, if you be in the cut
With the choppers, so dap m up, eat m for lunch
Shootin out the window saying Young Money, motherfucker

You niggas know shit from sugar
You niggas know kisses from bullits
See me in the Bentley, with one rolled window
You know a boss, I'm a booker
My bitch get tossed like I through her
A bitch get lost if I took her
To the thrift show to where I live, like, look here
I got a mansion in the cave, like Batman
And your girl pussy poppin on the handstand
You wanna flex up behind it, you a bad man
Young Money, strong funny, age like bam bam
Black Lamb on the interstate, coppers givin chace, bet you I could get away
Spitta!

Cut like a blender, chopper like the feegy
They got so many pussy nigggas, they starting to police me
I don't give a fuck, if you be in the cut
With the choppers, so dap m up, eat m for lunch
Shootin out the window saying Young Money, motherfucker

Yo, I'm sittin in the Chevy Shavell
With my favorite girl, she watchin Dave Chapell
While me, I'm on the selly, bout to blaze an L
Talkin to one of my homies, that's caged in jail
He tellin me bout this nigga that's raised in hell
Word done got back to him that I blazed his girl, now be callin like it's the end of the world
Now I gotta put in his world, close to daten, close to Satan
That's when you're gone when I see ya, I'm glad I'm me, cause, bitch, I wouldn't wwanna be ya
My niggas are like Freddikets, my life is the subject
Like Homer said, the greek homicides, I done it
What it is, ransom, parents, handsome
Make you feel it in your chest, like breast cancer
See Big said, niggas bleed just like us
But he never knew, niggas be cheese, just like us

Cut like a blender, chopper like the feegy
They got so many pussy nigggas, they starting to police me
I don't give a fuck, if you be in the cut
With the choppers, so dap m up, eat m for lunch
Shootin out the window saying Young Money, motherfucker

Skinny nigga, fat pockets
Shoot you in the back, just to get your back poppin
What you know about fat profit
Cause I got that bitch, in my back poket
Went straight to the grove, skipped college
Yeah, you know, me and Mack, had them streets poppin
Stylin on you, I unload this volume on you
Young B, with 2 gloccs
Make a nigga see double off, one shot
Rocks in my chain, like Barney Rubble
This ain't an axadent, I was born to hustle
Cut like a blender, chopper like the feegy
They got so many pussy nigggas, they starting to police me
I don't give a fuck, if you be in the cut
With the choppers, so dap m up, eat m for lunch
Shootin out the window saying Young Money, motherfuckerEmbed
