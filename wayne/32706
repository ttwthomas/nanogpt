Fly boy, yeah right, hehe
Hey mamma, they call me Weezy
And you should be with me, I got a pocket full of reasons
Baby, I could bless you when you ain't even sneezing
I'll be at your rescue when you don't even need me
I could have you dreaming when you ain't even sleeping
Mamma, I could help you get off, like the weekend
She said she wanna do it to the new Enrique
I pop the disc in and put the song on replay
And then she backed it up like replay
Hehehe

When you're near me
Girl, I try to hide it, but I can't escape it
Oh baby
Please forgive me
When I think of you, my thoughts are so X-rated
(Gotta forgive me, baby)
Oh baby

Baby, I don't give a damn
I know that your man's nowhere in sight, whoa-whoa
And your eyes don't tell a lie
I know you wanna come with me, tonight
And I say alright, but first you gotta

Okay, so after you back it up, just stop
Now drop it like it's hot, and pop it like a Glock
(Just Push it) And stop it like a watch, now move it like clockwork
Ya body is screamin' and ya booty is an outburst
She wanna do it, do it with no delay
I told her I could run it, run it just like relay
Yeah, cause I'm cool, just like the breeze way
And Push It like Salt-N-P-E-P-P-A

Push, push, back up on me (Girl)
Make me believe you want it
Push, push, back up on me (Girl)
Girl, I can't go home lonely (I like that)

Go ahead, lay it on me (Don't stop)
Don't stop until the morning (Girl)
Just keep pushing back on me
