Money long, the night is young
Another one
The world is ours (Ah)
DJ Khaled (Yeah)

I know a lot of niggas in here prolly hate me right now
But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That ain't gon' change a thing, no (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still gon' do my thing
I'm still, yeah-yeah, still gon' go and get mine (Get mine)
Still gon' keep on winnin' (Keep winnin')
Still gon' keep it one hunnid every time
You know I'm still, I'm still even when them niggas throw shots
I'm still, I'm still, still gon' end up on top
I'm still
Pussy ass niggas stop hatin'

Ralph, uh
Niggas be women like hoes be women
Look at me close, there's no sympathy
Those with envy be throwin' subliminal quotes
I'd rather them warrin' with me, uh
They phony, I hate them (Word)
Like Tony Montana, except no Manolo
She left me for another cuelo (Word)
These dudes is snakes, these women is vultures
Who am I to trust? Who gon' ride for me?
Who gon' light somebody body up?
When I be like, "Yup," they squeeze
Comfortably (Oh) and that new custom piece
My Tisci t-shirt a couple of G's (Oh)
I talked to a bunch of G's just like a Frozen Tundra speech
And the Lambo' feel
When a real nigga doin' one-ten tryna skrrt in it
Yeah, and the world so ill
When the boy get funny over money or a girl on ya
Uh, let it marinate
Uh, Wal', let me curate
Uh, let them niggas hate
But never, ever let a women tell a nigga, "Wait"'
(Yeah) Uh, sway
You might also like
I know a lot of niggas in here prolly hate me right now
But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That ain't gon' change a thing (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still gon' do my thing (I'm)
I'm still, yeah-yeah, still gon' go and get mine (Yeah, get mine)
Still gon' keep on winnin' (Yeah, keep winnin')
Still gon' keep it one hunnid every time
You know I'm still (Still), I'm still even when them niggas throw shots (Bang-bang)
I'm still, I'm still, still gon' end up on top
I'm still
Pussy ass niggas stop hatin' (Woo)

Most of these niggas ain't raw
Most of these niggas ain't poppin' (Niggas ain't poppin')
Most of these niggas ain't ballin'
Most of these niggas, they starvin'
Talkin' about cars and, what the fuck?
They don't even got 'em
So high, don't see no problems
Bitch, I'm on them trees like Tarzan (Trees like Tarzan)
Aw, man (Aw, man), I want all my cheese like Robin (Robin)
Shrimp or calamari, I'm a young nigga with options (Young nigga with options)
Mm (Mm), and you close, but y'all ain't close enough
In the VIP, call me the poster child for postin' up
Top floor suite, we goin' up
D.A.F., I'm dope as fuck
Woo (Woo), hundred bottles comin'
Mean a hundred bottles gettin' opened up
Rolex face all frozen
Expect y'all to hate, y'all ain't supposed to love it
She backin' up like a Tonka truck (Like a Tonka truck)
(Ah, yeah) Hahaha
I know a lot of niggas in here prolly hate me right now (Yeah)
But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That ain't gon' change a thing, no (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still gon' do my thing

Still gon' keep on winnin' (Keep winnin')
Still gon' keep it one hunnid every time
You know I'm still (I'm still, yeah), I'm still even when them niggas throw shots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still, I'm still, still gon' end up on top
I'm still
Pussy ass niggas stop hatin'

Fuck boy, I kept it real
Came up, wake up, feelin' blessed
Pockets full, no stress
At the top, We the Best
Cuttin' checks, eatin' good
Lovin' life, bitch, all night (Ace Hood)
(I'm still) I'm still gon' shine bright in that limelight

Woo, okay, now it's no more Mr. Nice Guy (Nah)
And you niggas couldn't see me in the daytime (Woo)
Girl, you got a better chance gettin' a day job (Haha)
Your career wouldn't blow up with the napalm (Boom)
Ha, silly motherfucker (Motherfucker)
I'm the type to win the game on the buzzer (On the buzzer)
I'm the type to make a whole lot of money
Buy a whole new crib 'cause I'm bored than a mother
And it's still fuck a hater
Still gon' ball like I'm Kobe from the Lakers (Ah)
Still We the Best, and it's still Hood Nation
And I'm still gon' smoke even if I'm on papers
Yeah, I know a lot of niggas in here prolly hate me right now (Yeah)
But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That ain't gon' change a thing, no (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still gon' do my thing
I'm still (Yeah), yeah-yeah, still gon' go and get mine (Get mine, yeah)
Still gon' keep on winnin' (Keep winnin')
Still gon' keep it one hunnid every time
You know I'm still (I'm still, yeah), I'm still even when them niggas throw shots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
