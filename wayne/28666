7 ContributorsRider Lyrics
Hahahahaa
Oh you we
Young Weezy Baby
Owwohh

I won't deny it, I'm a fuckin' rider
And you don't wanna fuck with me, ha
But I bet she gon' wanna fuck with me
Cause who wouldn't wanna fuck with me
Now I can't tell you shit 'bout the next man
But he ain't got nothin' on me
So baby, you should bury him
And just marry me, just marry me

Ok, I'm looking for a redbone
And when I get her, I'mma tap it like a fed-phone
And shorty talk about her man, she said she tired of him
I said, well baby I'mma have you tryin' to hide from him
And if its Weezy then the women wanna lie to him
And I'mma give it to em, mama said give it to em
So I'mma give it to her just the way she want it
I said girl I'm tryin to put my name on it
I'm tryin to own it
Welcome to my ranch, and I'mma act a donkey
From the mornin, to the night, to the mornin
And if you back it up, then I'mma jump on it
You might also like
I said I won't deny her
Shorty is a rider
And she gon ride for me
I said she lookin like my Bride to be
I take one knee
Let me take one knee
And I said, baby will you marry me
We live ever after happily
Just the way it's supposed to be
Just you and me
Just you and me

Haa
Yeah shorty said she want a rider
And I could be that image, more like a provider
I can provide her
And if you lookin for me I'm probably inside her
You only like her
I'm tryin to wife her
See I'm a lighter, and she's my fire
See we are tighter than grip pliers
She gets me higher, higher than my purp
Shortie's so bright when you look at her make your eyes hurt
Better get a visor
Oh yeah shes cold yeah shes cooler than an iceberg
Fuck what you might heard
You only like her, I'm tryin to wife her
And I said I won't deny her, shorty is a rider
And she gon ride for me
I said she lookin like my Bride to be
I take one knee, let me take one knee
And I said, baby will you marry me
We live ever after happily
Just the way that it's supposed to be
Just you and me, just you and me3Embed
