Shake your money maker
Don't break the money table
Take the money, baby
Do your thing
Ooo boy, if you love it when I shake my body
Hop on the train and get right behind me
Shake your money maker
Don't break the money table
Take a ride on the choo-choo train
Ooo boy, if you love it when I shake my body
Hop on the train and get right behind me

Boy, I like the way you make me dance up on the floor
When the song go up, I nod my head, I wanna hear more
I wanna rock, my ? body
I wanna move, my ? body
All my girls, ? a bar
Don't matter if you're big, fat, skinny, or small
Let's work, work, 'til the early morning
Let's get high, 'til the break of dawn
Everybody, just move your feet
All you ladies, come and shake your money maker with me

You might also like
Up in the club on the Hennessy
Fake booty clowns are shakin' on me
I can barely stand up
I can hardly see
I drank it down and hit the VIP
Love when we hit the back
You let me hit from the back
And back to floor, lookin' for more
I ? shorty at the bar
I might as well ?
