13 ContributorsWhoever You Like Lyrics
I said I'm stepping out with my niggas tonight
It's Young Money bitch and
You can do whoever you like
You can do whoever you like
I said Gudda Gudda, T-Streets, Drizzy Drake, Mack Maine
Jae Millz, Tyga Tyga, you can do whoever you like
You can do whoever you like

Baby we are so live you ain't gotta check for a pulse
Its Young Money, but you can call us multiple choice
See you can choose me, choose Mack or Gudda Gudd
Streets, Drizzy Drake, Tyga Tyga, or all the above
But no falling in love
We just fuck until we fall out and we fall asleep
You want a uptown hustler, you can call on me, I'm Jae Millz
For my money I make moves, like a R8 on the open street
I know you're nasty, I can see it in your eyes
I can tell how you move, it's written all in your vibe
So fuck your man, 'cause what he living is a lie
He commercial, it's only 10 seats on them planes that we fly
Plus I'm fly, and no exaggeration
But I'm so fly, fuck a plane, I'll get you to your destination
Holla at ya mizzann, it's Young Money
Life is good, fuck the forecast cause everyday is sunny
You might also like
Well, not actually, 'cause I make it rain
(Whatever you like) Yeah, you can pick the weather you like

Okay, Jae Millz, Gudda Gudda, Taz Po, T-Streets
Mack Maine, Tyga Tyga, you can do whoever you like
You can do whoever you like

Um, they ask me am I single and I tell 'em, "Hell no!"
They ask who I go with, I say, "Whoever wanna go!"
And we can go wherever you like
They ask me am I single, and I tell 'em, "Hell no!"
They ask who I'm fucking I say 'whoever wanna know'
And I can fuck whoever I like

Got my two fingers out the roof, see me repping out
The Levi's is skinny, so I'm walking with the weapon out
Two bitches on my arm, get my Don Juan on
Watch the hoes go crazy when the boy song on
Multicolored stones on, we getting money, yeah
I get my Styrofoam on, my cup muddy
Yeah I walk down on ya bitch, then I run away with her
Let her do what she like, then I have my way with her
I ain't trying to play with her, I ain't trying to stay with her
I'm just trying to dick her down, nigga, you can lay with her
So give me MySpace like dot com
I'm Funkmaster Flex, with the flow, I drop bombs
"Young Gudda Moneybags," that's what they calling me
Shitting on you boys like I'm sitting on the toilet seat
Y.M.O.B. we on that Soprano shit
Every day, we blowing cash, we be on that Hammer shit
Like you can't touch this, like you can't touch us with a pipe
But we can touch whoever we like
You could even do Lil Chuckee, Lil Twist, KY, Bobby V
Lil Scrap, didn't say me, 'cause I got a wife
So, sorry, not tonight

You see I hope your math is right
Take ya body as a sacrifice
You see them flashing lights
