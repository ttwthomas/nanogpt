1 ContributorThe Basement Freestyle Lyrics
Hahaha, hello world!
Uh, I'll talk to him
See, live from the, from the, from the..
Gotcha!

Life from the 504
It's Mr. Crazy flow
Jumping like a bungee, no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go
Nowhere, I'm nailed to the flo'
I am a sail to the water, money's the sail to my boat
And it's going down, it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
And you can smell what I smoke
And yep, I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water
Yeah, I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the Squid
L-L-Lilly pad homies L-L-Look at the monster
Man, you don't want to crash
Like La-La-La Bamba
See it's me, Roney, and Terry
And my new drop is berry
Watermelon, plum
Just call it fruit punch
I'm an old rapper
Getting new bucks
And all you new rappers
You're just new lunch
Flow sick
So sick
Need a Doc, yes
A creature
Monster
Like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the tick
Before I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock
"Gimme a sec"
I'm the middle of the war, where my enemy at?
I'm runnin' it like Eric Eric Bieniemy back
I hit a track I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out "Where the sympathy at?"
Okay, I'm finna be that
Whatever rich look like, well look I'm finna be that
They say money ain't everything
But I look better than that
It's Cash Money
Young money
Have a sweater with that
And just chillYou might also likeEmbed
