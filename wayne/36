33 ContributorsCarter II Lyrics
So you made it this far
We upstairs
I let you up here
You special
Marley, don't shoot 'em
You know what this is
It's still Tha Carter II, people
It's still Tha Carter II, people
Yeah, you're still in Tha Carter II, people
Hey, yeah

All I have in this world is a pistol and a promise
A fistful of dollars, a list full of problems
I address 'em like P.O. boxes
Yeah, I'm from New Orleans, the Creole cockpit
We so out of it, zero tolerance
Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it
I'm wealthy, still fuckin' with that block shit
Wet your ass up head to feet 'til your socks drip
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass
No snakes at the Carter, tell the gardener cut the grass
I hear 'em, but they talking under masks
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass
That's Cash Money, honeypie
We ain't running, we don't hide
Screamin', "Fuck the other side"
Don't get caught on it
This the deadliest grinds, I put your heart on it
And walk on it
The chalk's only for the art, homie
How they trace ya after I erase ya?
Look around
We at war and you still in preparation
I'm ridin' for them reparations, no patience
Slow paper is better than no paper
Fast money don't last too long, you got to pace it
You gotta know that paper
If you got it from a caper, gotta blow that paper
Gotta know that
Photophobia, no Kodak moments
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em, naw
I ain't even in the school yearbook
I don't do too much posing, got a cool killer look, ah
Career crook, get your career took
I'm back like a brassiere hook
Bitch, cheer
Camouflage gear, the hunter's here
Better play it by ear
You ain't nothing but a deer
Around here, and this here is Tha Carter
Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter
But get your boy some dipping sauce, I want the whole enchilada
I got 'em by the collar, watch me drop 'em
On they head at the bottom
You ain't got to shoot 'em 'cause I already shot 'em
And I ain't got to get 'em 'cause I already got 'em
Get 'emYou might also like17Embed
