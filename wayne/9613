1 ContributorU Know How We Do Lyrics
Wha, wha, wha, what?
Wha, wha, wha, what?
Wha, wha, wha, what?
Wha, wha, wha, what?

Look, look
I pass with the top off like my car was named Lil' Kim
The little pimp hopped out wrist lookin' like a skittles blimp
Do not introduce me to your chic, that'll get her flip
I'ma try not to mention that I'm rich, but it'll slip
I really whipped the Z doin' a hundred and thirty
Come back doin' 25 in a hunter Excursion
Open mouth and it'll beam like the sun is emergin
When I'm out, women scream like they thumbin' a virgin
Hummers be swervin' like I'm passin' y'all in speeding go-carts
She think she look like a basketball season score chart
Hotter than a damn blow torch, you see me sizzlin'
When your freak be missin, I got her twerkin n she be whistlin
Piece be glistenin every time it get a light reaction
Despite the braggin' my chest brighter than Michael Jackson
BMW motorcycle drag racing dawg
That playas raw call'em "Lil Wayne the Don"

When we come through you know how we do, dog
(Shoo, shoo) up the interstate with the roof off
We be shinin' in diamonds very blue, dog
Just the life in the ice'll make ya cool off
When we come through you know how we do, dog
(Shoo, shoo) up the interstate with the roof off
We be shinin' in diamonds very blue, dog
Just the life in the ice'll make ya cool off

Damn, I like to rep, I like to shine, I like to look good
B.Geezy let them niggas have it

I come through in somethin' new, hoes hollerin', "Look at him!"
That be the Hot Boy they call "Bling Bling Slim" (Bling)
Park the whip crooked, grab the heat, jump out
Everybody lookin' and sayin', "Damn he iced out" (Damn)
The chain I got on costs more than your dream house (Damn)
Presidential Roley, don't even want talk about
Say whodi look at your bitch, she drooling from the mouth (Eww)
Wanna ride wit lil' B.G. and wildout
Don't trip, let her come dip wit' me dawg
I share them lips wit Weezy 'til she get locked jaws
I'm a fool wit it, niggas know but don't want admit it
It's cool, long as you respect me, I'm chillin'
Cross the line I draw for ya, it's a killin' (Killin')
It's gonna be click, clack blucka, blucka brain spillin (Spillin')
Until then I'm reppin, Stuntin flossed out
You see me if you up north and I'm down south

When we come through you know how we do, dog
(Shoo, shoo) up the interstate with the roof off
We be shinin' in diamonds very blue, dog
Just the life in the ice'll make ya cool off
When we come through you know how we do, dog
(Shoo, shoo) up the interstate with the roof off
We be shinin' in diamonds very blue, dog
Just the life in the ice'll make ya cool off
Nigga, don't think I changed, I grew up doin' good
Still: fuck, chill, and get my hair cut in the hood
Never forget where I come from, I'm too real
Never forget the days I had to get it how I live
But it's better now; I'm on another level now
I got cheddar now; I got my shit together now
I'm livin' swell nigga, I'm givin' hoes hell nigga
My broad is in order, I refuse to fail nigga
Benzos, Beamers, and Bentleys
Man I'm ballin', go to a dice game wit a hundred G's
Lose it, laugh 'bout it, nigga like me don't miss it
Make a phone call get my bitch to come bring me fifty
Shoot that, it's all gravy, I get that there from Baby
When I struggle niggas love me, now they can't take me
But as long as they don't fuck wit' me, I don't worry bout'em
But if they fuck wit me, you gone have to worry bout'em

When we come through you know how we do, dog
(Shoo, shoo) up the interstate with the roof off
We be shinin' in diamonds very blue, dog
Just the life in the ice'll make ya cool off
When we come through you know how we do, dog
(Shoo, shoo) up the interstate with the roof off
We be shinin' in diamonds very blue, dog
Just the life in the ice'll make ya cool off
Wha, wha, wha, wha, what?
Just the life in the ice'll make ya cool offEmbed
