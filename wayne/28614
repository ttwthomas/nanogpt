34 ContributorsGet Over Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah, real rap (Real rap), real rap for ya
Yeah
Lighters up
Know you miss somebody (Got to)
Put your (Yeah), let's go (Get 'em)

Though, though I'm missing you (Straight to your head, man)
I'll find a way to get through (Nik', talk, yeah)
I know livin' without ya is impossible (Yeah, that's right)
And I, I know you gon' live on (Cry, mama, yeah, cry, mama)
'Cause you were my brother (My sister)
And I love ya, and I miss ya, oh-oh

Stay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell ya
He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor
Standin' on stage in front of thousands (Yeah)
Don't amount to me not havin' my father
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em
And I'm without 'em, but that's life, y'all
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard (Yup)
I'm alright, God, shit, I'm still breathin'
But loss hurt like bullets, I'm 'bout to start bleedin'
Throw me down some comfort 'cause my heart need it (Yeah)
Tryna cope but my chances are needle
There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin' to take it easy
Rest in peace Lil Beezy, my nigga
You might also like
Though, though I'm missing you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I miss my dawg, I can't believe that it's over)
I'll find a way to get through (But I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
I know livin' without ya is impossible (Can't stay sober, I'm just tryna get over)
And I, I know you gon' live on (Real rap for you)
(Man, I miss my dawg, I can't believe that it's over)
'Cause you were my brother (My sister, but I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
And I love ya, and I miss ya, oh-oh (Can't stay sober, I'm just tryna get over)

And now we smoke kush all day and pop painkillers (Yeah)
Fuck who don't understand it, this what the game did us
This what the streets showed us, this how the block made us
The same block where they layed 'em (Damn)
I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me
Lord, will I be next for the taking? Take me
I know I'm livin' like I know when I'm comin'
But I'm just livin' 'cause I know that it's comin'
And the end is comin', but I ain't runnin', I ain't hidin' and duckin'
I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it
I'm just speakin' from the heart of the dyin' public
We still beatin', we gon' rise above it
Though it seem like they cheatin' and we losin'
We survive, if nothin'
They could never take the stride from struggling
I gotta ride, and sometimes that ride get bloody
But I just think about my buddy and go after that money
But, uh
Oh (Yeah), we gotta get over (Yeah)
We gotta get over, we gotta get over (Yeah)
It's almost over (I said, I said I gotta get over)
And we gon' be alright (I gotta get over)
('Cause, bitch, I'm a soldier)

Straight Patrón out the bottle to the head now (Bitch)
We gettin' red now, bitch, my nigga dead now (Bitch)
And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now (Damn)
I shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds (Damn)
Now I gotta walk around, brim down
Just tryin' to find my way 'til the next day, escape
Your birthday could be your death date
So I'm livin' like it was just yesterday, let's pray
Ten fingers together, can't bring 'em together
It's murda-murda, I don't think it get better
So be a competitor or get out the weather
Me? I got an umbrella and a Beretta (Rah)
I'm just tryin' to make sure my daughter future progressin'
And behind that, I'm shootin' excessive (Bang), trust me (Yeah)
The beautiful dead, we living with the ugly
I just tell my pops, "Wait for me, I'm comin'"

Though, though I'm missing you (Yeah, yeah)
(Man, I miss my dawg, I can't believe that it's over)
I'll find a way to get through (But I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
I know livin' without ya is impossible (Can't stay sober, I'm just tryna get over)
And I, I know you gon' live on (They ask me what's wrong)
(Man, I miss my dawg, I can't believe that it's over)
'Cause you were my brother (My sister, but I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
And I love ya, and I miss ya, oh-oh (Can't stay sober, I'm just tryna get over)
They ask me why I wear shades at nighttime
(Man, I miss my dawg, I can't believe that it's over)
'Cause I don't wanna see nothin' (But I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
Yeah (Can't stay sober, I'm just tryna get over)
Like I said (Man)
Life ain't nothin' but a long extended road, keep drivin'
(But I'm a soldier, so I gotta get over)
I done passed up plenty people on the side of road, no help
Keep goin', yeah (I'm just tryna get over)
Lost a lot of passengers on the ride, kept goin', yep
(But I'm a soldier, so I gotta get—)
Who knows when I'll run outta gas? Yeah (Over)3Embed
