1 ContributorSo Fly (feat. Chop) Lyrics(yeah) weezy is so fly in any weather
Hold up (ah pu) there goes the feather
Y'all niggas ain't even shoulder level
And i ain't on hova level, im over level
Im watching t.v with Regina and Angela
Im on they brain like some mutha fuckin amplas (yeah)
Shake something like dancers
Question my swag and get a mutha ffckin answer
Yeah

Umm, weezy a.k.a bring your girl to my tour bus
She ain't getting off unless she getting off unless she gettin off two of us dont give me that cup unless that f*ckin cup poured up
And when i say poured up
I mean with sorup
Young money baller
I deserve a tall bitch
If these walkies talk, they ain't talk bout yall shit (yeah)
Man i swear im so fly
I wake up in the sky
And wipe the cloud out my eyeYou might also likeEmbed
