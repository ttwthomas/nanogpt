2 ContributorsRebel Yell Lyrics
I got you T-Baby, it's Weezy
I'm in the game, I need a timeout
Fuck around and wake up at everyone house
Cause I'm 'bout what you ain't
What you aren't, you foreign
To a rebel, now hear me yell ho
Fireman, turn your pussy to a hell hole

Last night a little dancer came dancing to your door
Last night it got freaky, and started dancin' on the floor
He said, now come to me babe, I got a license for love
And if it expires, I can't help you no more

In the midnight hour babe, he cried "more, more, more, more"
With a rebel yell, he cried "more, more, more"
In the midnight hour babe, he cried "more, more, more, more"
With a rebel yell, he cried "more, more, more"
More, more, more

He don't like slavery, won't sit, sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely, he sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to be me babe?
What set you free?
I need you hear by me, because
You might also like

He lives in his own heaven
But we can get it on, get it on, 24/7 yeah
We up all night, heaven
And just as long, just as long, you don't mess up my hair

Well I'mma do you like new psycho bananas
Cameras, hammers, never mind
You wouldn't understand, you just a fool
But she know when she need a fix, hammerman, I got them twos
And a lot of dudes are not me
Cause I am not even who is inside me
No homo, but I need help
But until then, it is rebel yell
It is rebel yell
