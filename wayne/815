94 ContributorsCongratulations Lyrics
Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations
See Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right, uh
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off your chest"
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention12Embed
