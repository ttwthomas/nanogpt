2 ContributorsRide On Lyrics
So you think it ain't right
The way I give mine
And what you describe
Well let me tell you like this
When I didn't have nothing
There weren't nobody giving me nothing
So I had to make something happen
The only way I know how
Was probably go down
Cos everybody was singin' and rappin'
I get my ride on
(Chorus)
Ride on (ride on) with all of my niggas
So what you hear me say
Right one, cos it's bout to get bigger
But I still gotto ride on
To get up on top
Cos he told me not to leave it a lot
That must keep lights on

I was reading in the paper yesterday
Say they cleaning up the streets around my way
To many niggas on the corner
Couldn't make no money if you wonna
And not one time riding through everyday
So I'm thinking like
Things bout to get a whole lot better
Black 64 with a trunk full of chedder
Picture my homies all born in the ghetto
Khakis with an Iceburg sweater
Listen to me
When my mama stop working
I can stop this shit
But until that day you gotta deal with this
I told y'all I'm a stay real with this
Still make a couple mil with this
You might also like(Chorus)

Off the top this lil nigga is off the meter
Warn your people
Wayne is a walking heater
Flames all over
The game"s all over
I told y'all niggas
Now your reigns all over
Listen, don't play with me
That's cos I strap up quick
But holla tips
And Glock clips
And my niggas they don't spray quickly
Thats cos I kiss my ride on
It time to kill niggas cos the lights on
Bandana tied on
Platinum over ice
Ten I brick the price
It's raw with no slice
I'm duckin' blue and whites
And yellow drive presser
Guns off my dresser
Set em on my leather
See Atrice told me to ride like that
So I'm a be like that
Thats how I get come Weezy Wee like that
I'm from the streets like that
And on these streets I'm gonna die
The G-code is what we live by
Forever ride
(Chorus till fade)Embed
