Yeah, Dedication 6, of course
Shout out Guru for sendin' me the beat, too
Young Angel, Young Lion
More Life, no dyin'
Yeah, alright, I got it, yeah

Super Bowl goals, I'm at the crib with Puff
He got Kaepernick on the phone, he in a whole different mode
Angel hair at 2AM for Bey and Hov
Just to show 'em how I treat the city like my humble abode
Ayy, tell me if TD Bank is approvin' loans
I'm thinkin' of payin' Wayne what Universal owes
My nigga spent a lifetime goin' platinum and gold
He should own half of the label, shit outta control
Somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need some ownership if we pressin' go
'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like "A Milli" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas
I make the crib, expandin' pools and expandin' rooms
Addin' Hammam Spas with tannin' booths, nigga
That's truth, no boost, nigga
But this isn't all about callin' truce
I'm still dishin' out verbal abuse
That shit could get re-introduced
If somebody got somethin' they urgin' to prove, nigga
Inspirin' to the youth
New Years Eve, lookin' like a royal flush
Wait, we all in the same suit
I'm Hall of Fame in the booth, nigga
My karma makin' the news, nigga
This pudding taste like the proof, nigga
If I ever see Trump, he better salute niggas
Much as we do, nigga, for real
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Six shit

I could care less 'bout your squad, I don't connect when I'm flyin'
I'm on a jet and it's mine, I just hope the weather is fine
I took the jet to Dubai, I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet way to Africa, shout out my nigga Akon
Your bitch sweatin' my squad, please get the sweat out her eye
I put the dick in her spine, I fucked the bitch in her prime
Don't get my credit declined, give all the credit to Moms
I flipped the bird at the Bird – hey, what's for dinner? Popeyes
These chickens got bird flu, and they chirp, chirp too
Always sung, never flew, these boys Hot Girls too
If money grow on trees, I climb and rest in that bitch
Build a treehouse and knock the bird nest out that bitch
Stuck my neck out and shit, then got the heck out that shit
And when I did, I took the special effect out of that shit
Tunechi F 'round this bitch, the best thing left 'round this bitch
All you niggas some bitches, I feel like Hef 'round this bitch
You call her Stephanie, I call her Steph 'round this bitch
Now back to whippin' the baby on some step mama shit
I come direct with my shit, I come correct with my shit
A blank check on your face, put some respek on my shit
Branches startin' to shake, here comes the leaves, get the rake
I want my piece of the cake, it should be sweeter than cake
Here come the leaves, get the rake, and we ain't leavin' the rake
We made the cleanest escape, although I bleeped in your face
You playin' with the right one today
Your flag is a white one today
You wearin' em tight ones today
Check me or write one today
You playin' with fire today
The Angel and Lion are greats
Oh my God, lightning strikin' twice in this place
Should we make a wish or should we make it right in this place?
All this motherfuckin' beef, I need some rice on this plate
Talked to your wifey today, she feelin' triflin' she say
Talked to the sniper, he say he aimin' at diapers today
Pick you off like pickin' peppers, Peter Piper today
So tell your squad I say "BLAOW" like Spice 1 would say
It's Mortal Kombat tonight, it's Street Fighter today
I'm Major Bison, Drizzy lit like Raiden light up the place
You see blue face hundreds 'til you white in the face
Oh my God, it feel like I done life in this place
But swear to God, I got money doin' life in my safe
Put on the gloves like MJ, go from OG to OJ
I make you pay attention then rip your receipt in your face
This for Cita and Nae, this for my people and bae
I got three sons of a gun, them niggas keep me on safe
Hol' up, I am the black god to the church
I am the fat boy to dessert
I am the landlord to the first, got two bangers
One of them go "bada boom," one of them go "bada bing"
I taught these hoes how to love, I taught these boys how to lean
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle, the eyes don't lie 'til you blink 'em
Keep the iron for the wrinkles
The mansion came with the sprinklers
I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
Yeah, you know life is a movie, you niggas playin' yourselves, damn
That's some six shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
It's every man for themselves, it's every baby for sale
And you know life is a movie, you niggas ratin' yourself
I just hope it’s a porn to watch you pussies play with yourself
That's some six shit26Embed
