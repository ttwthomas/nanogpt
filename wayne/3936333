5 ContributorsIf U Lookin for Me Lyrics
If you're out there in the street, and your lookin for me
Bitch, I be hustlin like a dog, tryna make ends meet
Anybody ever try to get in my way
Then you know Imma be going to jail for murder today

Put the shot, then head straight to the block
Call me and Wayne Smooth with the rock
Rich and move work, you get it out quick
Yeah I know I rap, but I'm livin off bricks
On that Lean that I'm sellin, I'm pourin
Three's only one, motherfucker, you know who it is
Blow one, motherfucker, get how we live
But we still throgh it up, that's how we is

Make it rain, make it flood in the drout
I got two halfs and them quarters, that's what I'm bout
That's why I chuck 4 blocks, come with 4 pocks
Bad bitches cookin for me, the feends is lookin for me
I can't lie, homie, I like myself
Pour up a 4 a lil, before I'm myself
You know you might see me on the flight, or in the Caraira
Yeah, we got that white, but we still the stars of the eara
You might also like
If you're out there in the street, and your lookin for me
Bitch, I be hustlin like a dog, tryna make ends meet
Anybody ever try to get in my way
Then you know Imma be going to jail for murder today

Smokin something, man, feelings beating me down
Bad asses, sellin Crack and stacks
Shit whent from tarific to tragic
Niggas talkin shit, I'll put a hit out on them bastards
Slow them boys down, like Los Angeles trafic
My diamonds is dancin, like television static
Don't throgh the coach on the first day of practice
Donuts in the 24, bitch, I'm matchin
I'm a green feend, no controlin me
Talkin bout that Cabbage, I be stackin
You niggas is pussy, you be foldin and crackin
My niggas is wishin, I tell m to have it and let shit happen
Cuttin down the neck from the bottom of the baskit
These 16s make you rearange your brackets
Hit the final four with my final horse
Fall asleep in the sky, box orbs
Spitta!

If you're out there in the street, and your lookin for me
Bitch, I be hustlin like a dog, tryna make ends meet
Anybody ever try to get in my way
Then you know Imma be going to jail for murder today
Hate it or love it, we thuggin in public
You rappers ain't eatin, your food cost out of your budget
Your rappers half edea, you spittin your court cases
I spit that boss music, try the fource music
This how a boss move it
36 Os, we don't play halfs, we don't even fuck hoes
And I ain't talkin Coopes, I said pay attention
Let them haters gosep, murders my entention

If you're out there in the street, and your lookin for me
Bitch, I be hustlin like a dog, tryna make ends meet
Anybody ever try to get in my way
Then you know Imma be going to jail for murder todayEmbed
