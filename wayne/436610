Good, good, good, good
You that good, good
Good, good, good, good
Rocko fuck wit me
Good, good, good, good
Good, good, good, good
She got that good, good, good, good

That’s good news, I’m gettin' money
Keep good goods, come shop with me
Hustler, that’s automatic
Just a good guy, with some bad habits
Can't lie, we have a good time
I catch a good one, and tell her good bye
Gave her somethin' to eat, she ate it all
We made a good movie, rated R
Good noise, that’s good music, no Kanye
I’m on the runway, Tit Bar learjet
Round trip, that’s a good check
Gimme gimme, good and plenty
OPP, good as any
She gotta do, what he will do
She want a Superman, I hit her with that yule
Said sometimes, I tap on that too
By one she was saying sometimes
She a bad girl, she a good bitch
I mean a good girl, bad bitch
Same thing so it's all good
You might also like
Good, good, good, good
She got that good
Good, good, good, good
Good, good, good, good

She got that good I think I love her
But all good pussy ain't good for you
And I can’t believe it’s not butter
And when I’m in it, I see the light
But a blind man gave me advice:
Don't believe in love at first sight
I don't fuck, I make love
You can't be mad at passion
I close my eyes and let magic happen
She swallows all of my battery acid
I'm smoking on that good
She got that good, good
And I'm a good fella
What more can you ask for?
That's a good question and why?
Crazy bitches got the best pussy
That’s why I’m still fuckin' my ex pussy
I swear
It's so nice I had to say good twice
But all good things had to come to an end bitch
Good night
Good, good, good, good
She got that good
Good, good, good, good
Good, good, good, good

Good Ice Cubes on me, yea, today gonna be a good day
My old yay, my best friend, keep good work, I making good pay
Getting good money, got good game
Got good scent, got good brain
Every time I see her it's a good thing
I can’t feel my legs in a good way
Good head, got good pussy
Goodness grace she getting gushy
She look good, she a good look
Give her good wood, she gives a good juke
Good hair, try to pull it out
Young MVP, I can't pull her out
She a good sport, supposed to play good ball
She a good catcher, good Lord
On my Goodness for goodness sake
She in good shape, but got a good shape
Say she get off work between 6 to 9
I know the day, I'm filled with 6 to 8
Good head, got good dick
She a bad girl, she a good bitch
I mean a good girl, bad bitch
Same thing so it's all good
Good, good, good, good
She got that good
Good, good, good, good
Good, good, good, good12Embed
