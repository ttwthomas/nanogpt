13 ContributorsWhen They Come For Me Lyrics
And tell them boys
I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' every day
With every pistol that I own
Tell 'em I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' every day with every pistol
Every day with every pistol

Nigga you done fucked up
Nigga back the fuck down
I don't care where I go
I don't care who you know
Don't care about what you say
I'll put them words back down your throat
I don't care where you stay
Nigga I'm from Uptown
I gotta get 'em Slim
They talkin' beef to me
They just a bunch of bitches
They talkin' sweet to me
Pussy niggas
I guess I gotta eat pussy
I put a hole in 'em
Now that's a deep pussy
The cops hate me
But a star is born
The streets love me
But how long will they mourn
I'm a real nigga
Say real nigga thangs
Bullet don't have no name
You might also like
And tell them boys
I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' every day
With every pistol that I own
Tell 'em I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' every day with every pistol
Every day with every pistol

Look, I never fold
Man, I just take my chance
I let life deal
And I just play my hand
Protection off safety
I look straight ahead
"I got them niggas, Weezy"
That's what the .380 said
You gotta play in the field to get paid
And then you gotta go lay
In that bed that you made
It's Cash Money
This the army brigade
And I'm spittin' like I ate a grenade
I'm dippin' in the 8 with the fade
With the wing in the butt
Yeah, put the wings up
And straight show 'em my guts
Yuck
Ain't my swagger so mean
And I know how to operate that machine
Brrrrrtt
I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' everyday
With every pistol that I own
Tell 'em I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' everyday with every pistol
Everyday with every pistol
Yeah

Aim at his brain
Make a nigga learn
And if that's chopper bullets
Then they supposed to burn
And if you've been in jail
I never saw a cell
But I come from New Orleans
Yeah, right there under Hell
I tell my gal "Don't you worry 'bout nothin'
But see, these niggas want me dead
So hold me tight when ya fuck me"
I told her
"I'm strapped, I'm a rider, girl
And I'mma shoot from every side
Like Around The World"
Believe that, and you can tell 'em bring the whole gang
I'm gon' get you with that automatic touchin' errthang
Nigga, it's the Birdman, JR. — Pure Pain
You just a curb stain
And tell them boys
I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' everyday
With every pistol that I own
Tell 'em I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga
That got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' everyday with every pistol
Everyday with every pistol12Embed
