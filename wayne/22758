5 ContributorsStick & Move Lyrics
I don't have all day to be chillin'
Just talkin' shit
You done got me out here now
I'm tryin' to get off this brick
I don't trust you to be up in your spot
Niggas'll blitz
These faces ain't familiar right now
I'm 'bout to split
Look, if you really want 'em
They going for 17
Other than that
I'm dropping 'em off in the mail for me
Nigga hit me on my hip
Back to back
Gotta make a St. Rose run
Cause lil' one say he got five stacks
Rush hour is the best time
To hustle for me
I hit the I-10
Blowin', pickin' up in the east
Droughts hit
But you gotta keep your ears to this street shit
Exchangin' numbers with niggas
To see what's the sweet-test deal
If it ain't
I'm chalk it up as a loss
Forever lookin' for the best shit
At minimum cost
I move around like some ants in my pants
Networkin'
You ain't got what I'm lookin' for
I'm movin' on to the next ones

I came in this motherfucker
Hundred grand strong
And every other month
Another hundred adds on
Don't tell me how to spend it
Cause a motherfucker grown
Now every other month
Another Caddy on chrome
Nigga
I'm sick wit it
These niggas heads be bangin'
Motherfucker dropped the dime
And told the feds be slangin'
Can't tell 'em what they don't know
Like it don't show
And if I lay low
A lotta niggas won't sco'
I'm waitin' now
I gotta a lotta niggas on post
For dope and coke
And a lotta niggas want both
Get on my cheddar route
I'm bout to flood it out
Get me a 30 day run
Switch to another house
And leave the last one
For the Feds to investigate it
I need another 30 days
Francesca made it
I told her meet me at the Sheraton
Test and waited
Now another Caddy roll so I'm ask for 80

Wodie you must be trippin'
Think you gon' catch me slippin'
Hit a hustle and come up
Never that
I pop the clip in
Had a feelin' you was plottin'
Been waitin' for you to move
Ain't bout takin' no fall
Gotta be on my P's and Q's
You know how the game go
It's either you win or lose
Bitch nigga baller blockin'
Bitch nigga gotta get blues
You know +I Got that Work+
And I'm the man on my turf
Got everything you need
When you come ask for Turk
Down where I'm from
It's hot, so +Do Whatcha Do+
But to be quick
My nigga
You gotta stick and move
I know you don't wanna get caught
In the midst of the sweep
You got caught with that work
Nothin' you can say to the police
You ride
They gon' tell ya
Save that for the judge
Your third time in front that man
So it ain't no love
That's why
When I do sumthin'
Ain't no plan allowed
I do the job
Get the money
Then I head on out

I lock it down
Powder and brown
Get my two-way number playa
And on the humble
Get your bricks
The size of lumber playa
It's all love and I sprazy
But when the Feds in
We keep our heads in
You comprehend?
I'm a motherfucking monster
In the South bitch
I re-up early
So I can sprout shit
For when the drought hit
The block burnin' dawg
The thugs thuggin'
The drugs runnin'
The slugs bustin'
In a minute, the bugs comin'
The messy hoes talkin'
The dope fiends walkin'
The fucking law's stalkin'
It's bigger than what you think
See, the hustlin' is a +Way of Life+
Cousin, we gotta breathe
And in the hood
We gotta lotta needs
You feel me nigga?
So, in the mean
While I be showerin'
The whole metropolitan
Issue out cocaine like scholarships
Congratulations
Dawg, it's all fire
Not a vict refused
But when the law scour in
Nigga I sticks and move
Ya heard me

(Baby) You know them niggas on the grind round here
(Juvenile) Stick and move
(Baby) You know then niggas slang that iron round here
(Juvenile) Stick and move
(Baby) The task force pass on time round here
(Juvenile) Stick and move
(Baby) My own paper my P.O. be tryin' to pass round here
