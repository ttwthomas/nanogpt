1 ContributorLoser (remix) LyricsThe loser microphone abuser
Feet hurtin i just walked from
Juersalem
So you should get onside with the movement
Im the proof
And ill die just to prove it
Whatcha ya wanna to know?
Anything, whatever
I can't tell ya, i can show ya better
Me and my gun
We took an oath together
We swear we never die if we both together
Girl this is my testifcation
Ima wayne on they head like precepitation
And inhale you you need justifaction
But but for me it is just a vacation
Yeah, you can check my reservation
And youll see the top is my destination
You should admire my dedication
Im a winner just call me congratulations!
