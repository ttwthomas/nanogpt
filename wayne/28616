66 ContributorsBest Rapper Alive Lyrics
Fuck with me
Thank you
Yeah (Come on), yeah, yeah (Come on)
You know me, man, yeah (Come on), yeah (Come on)
Alright, hahaha
Oh, Fee, I got 'em, boy
Weezy Baby (C2, yeah)
Weezy Baby (Three)
You can't see me
But I see you (Yeah)
And I see you (Yeah)
Lord
I, I, I got 'em

Bring the crowd in, I'm loud in living color
It is Weezy Fuckin' Baby, got these rappers in my stomach
Yummy, I'm taking it, I ain't askin' them for nothing
If you sell a million records, we could battle for your money
I'd rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a Sunday
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play
Still stuntin', baby, yes, I'm still flossin'
Latest car on the market with the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a little bulky
You look a little salty, have yourself a chilled coffee
Chill out, the guns is still out
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out
I'm busy, I got paper to reel in
God, I hope they snappin' at the end of my rod
I hope I'm fishin' in the right pond
And I hope you catchin' on to every line, who am I?

And you should be afraid, be very afraid (Yeah), yeah

The heart of New Orleans, thumpin' and beatin'
Livin' and breathin', stealin' and feedin'
Peelin' and leavin', killin' and grievin'
Dearly departed, erased, deleted
No 'prints, no plates, no face, no trace
Out of sight, out of mind, no court, no case
Sell his chain, celebrate, block party, second line
Zulu Ball, Essence Fest, Jazz Fest, Mardi Gras
Shotty bounce, body rock, now he dropped, now he got
Family try tell the feds, tell the cops
Smell a rat comin' back to the house, to the spot
Tap-tap, knock-knock, who is that? Chk-pow
Triggaman, hoodie man, tell the kids Boogieman
Pistol Pete, Ammo Mammal, gunman, blum-blam (Haha)
Damn, Sammy, you done fucked up
Pussy-ass niggas, put your nuts up, just call me
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh, yep)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh)

The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh)
Swagger right, check (Uh), game tight
And you should be afraid, be very afraid, yeah

Fuck up with all these rookie MCs?
Whew, smell like a bunch of pussy to me
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em good, fuck 'em long
Fuck 'em hard, fuck who? Fuck 'em all
Yeah, like that, just like that, right back
I'm on that money train and that MAC'll knock 'em off track
The quarterback, well-protected from the Warren Sapp
The young heart attack, I spit that cardiac
You can't see me, baby boy, you got that cataracts
I'm right here, straight out the hood just like an alley cat
Since everyone's a king, well, where the fuck your palace at?
Me? I got callous on my hands, I can handle that
It's no problem, baby, I so got 'em
It's just a victory lap, baby, I'm just joggin'
Yeah, and I ain't even out of breath
The motherfuckin' best yet, sorry for cussin' (Who?)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh, yep)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh)
Swagger right, check (Uh), game tight
And they gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me (Who?)
