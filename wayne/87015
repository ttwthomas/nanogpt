14 ContributorsDon’t Want You To See Me Cry Lyrics
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Yea, Rest In Peace Lil Naughty, that's suck
Fuck you bitches, coppers
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Yea, if you laughing...
Now is the time to stop
Yea, you understand?
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
This here's real man, harsh but hard
If you can't take it, you damn sure can't take the weight

Momma had to hustle cause my pop was jive
Momma had 1 son, 2 jobs
What a woman! Come from where the women gotta work like men
So we ain't need dad, we got money like him
No school clothes, no child support
And next year I'll probably be up in a Robb Report
I'm important, so is my clique I'm riding for them
God lead us not into dividing waters
Guide my daughter see that she walk a straight one
Them fake guys, please see that she don't date one
I live positive stay away from snitches, haters and broke niggas with they face hung
All the folks are ready for whenever that day come
Got a cool two million hiding until that case comes
See me just a a riding to the bass drum
So if you feel me put ya blunts in the air
And blaze one and don't cry
You might also like
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid
Baby, I'm just a man
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
I pop me a pill so I don't feel the pain just to tell y'all this shit
For the hood!
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry

I'm on the grind like all the time
I got money, but murder don't cost a dime
So I'm flossing mine and if jacking me cross ya mind, you done lost ya mind
All sorts and kinds of car, jewels, clothing
I'm looking like a porcupine
How sharp am I?
But niggas wanna bring out the dark in I
But, me, I'm so bright, I keep walking by
Keep barking hater, yeah, ya talk a lot, but me I'm at the top and I ain't talking down
Man they acting like they don't know I'm from Apple & Eagle
But the eagle will bust ya apple fo sho
So I'm gonna let it rock
Until they let Bubba out the cell block
I'm a hold it down let the whole bottles pop
And light the weed up
Straighten ya collar
Fix ya G up and don't cry!
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid
Baby, I'm just a man and
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
I remember the look on your face, momma, when them doctors told you I made it your son is gonna be aight he made it
I remembered then they come in there and they asked me did I wanna see you
I told them no
I was only scared
This some crazy shit
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry

I got shot when I was 12
Lost my pop when I was 14
Shot again at 20 will I shake these old dreams
Lord wake me up to holy water on my face and 3 blood drops dried on the side of my eyes
Why we gotta kill our own kind when we rise
Got me looking down the ladder now when I climb
Pulling up on my nephews
And they don't wanna drive
They wanna learn how to work the tool
And who am I not to do the duty
Just think if pops advice get sent from black ink
And that stinks, but homie that's real
And in the hood even steaks smell bad on the grill
I remember when if you was a hustler you was a winner
Now that's like raking up leaves in the winter
And that ain't even cool to miss a few summers, shit
I'll take a bite out the onion like fuck it!
And won't cry
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid
Baby, I'm just a man and
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry

And straight level vodka's the potion, makes me spill my emotion and
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Keep on coming with that gangsta music, Young Weezy got that motherfucking gangsta music
Yo so ride to to it y'all and vibe to it y'all, hey and
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Keep on coming with that gangsta music
Young Weezy got that motherfucking gangsta music
Yo, so ride to to it y'all and vibe to it y'all, hey

Real talk real rap right here for ya
Uh huh
Young Maine rapping wit me
Ro, D.I, My nigga Trill Real coming to the hospital
Lil Bootie bitch getter
Yes sir

Young Mal, Young Capo, Young Tanz on the back

I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
You already know
Birdman, I see ya
You already know ya son got this
I appreciate the step up in office
I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry
Yeah that shit almost made me cry
But you know presidents don't cry right?
