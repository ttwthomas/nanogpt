14 ContributorsGot Em Lyrics
Chef prepared dinner eating ass nigga
World renowned clit and feet and ass kisser
You best beware of me you cheating ass nigga
Cause when she leave your ass I send a limo, not a cab nigga
It's Carter Luther King she free at last nigga
I’m who she with when you can't reach her ass nigga
I tell her it's gon be okay then squeeze her hand
Then I make her feel younger than Peter Pan nigga

I done went blind on they ass
Come your fine ass here I get behind all that ass
Leave his ass behind girl, shine on his ass
How you spending time with me but serving time with his ass?
Deuces on his ass
Dining somewhere probably eating sushi on his ass
We probably somewhere quiet watching movies bout romance
I got you on an island with a booty full of sand, and you come back with that new booty and new boobies on his ass
And now, all of a sudden he wanna play husband, he wanna lay up and he wanna make up and he wanna straighten up and
It been too late for it
I renovate for him, now she say fuck him
Cause he ain’t bout shit, Let him know I got this
Girl tell him get off your dick

Tell him I say
Got em, got em, got em (she's gone)
Got em, got em, got em (she's gone)
I got em, I got em, I got this, I got em, I got her, I got em, I got em

Lord I done went blind on they ass
Her fingers in my hair, and you know mine in her pants
She sit me in the chair and then she tie up my hands
She get on her hands standing, put her legs on my shoulders
69 on that ass, 7 days a week I put this fire on her ass
So when he wanna fuck she be too tired for his ass
She used to think the stuff that she can buy for his ass
Now all she think about is stuff that I can try with that ass
And now all of a sudden he wanna play husband
He wanna lay cuddlin, He wanna make up and
He wanna straighten up and, it been too late for it
I renovate for him, Then she say fuck him
Now it's time (now it's time girl)
For you to go and dye your hair blonde (alright, alright)
We're one of a kind (twins), oh Lord (double trouble), Yeah
Now she's mine, I'm sure she’ll let him know in her spare time
And fuck his response (fuck him), Oh Lord
Cos he ain’t bout shit, let him know I got this
Girl tell him get off your dick (bye)

Tell him I said
Got em, got em, got em, got em, got em, got em
I got em, I got em, I got this, I got em, I got em, I got em, I got em
Lord I done went blind on their ass
Girl come your fine ass here I get behind all that ass
And grind on that ass
You tired of his ass and you tired of his lies
Time to spread your wings, open wide butterfly
Time to do your thing, rub your eyes butterfly
He was nothing but a fling, just some fries on the side
I know nothing's what it seems, and you tried many times
Got the man of your dreams, then surprise "rise and shine" (Lord)
So now it’s time (time, girl)
It's time for you to go off and do your thing, your own thing
And you should change your line
And before you leave give him back that small ring
It don't bling

Now all of a sudden he wanna play husband
He wanna lay cuddlin
He wanna make up and
He wanna straighten up and
It been too late for it
I renovate for him
And then we say fuck him
Cause he ain't bout shit (Cause he ain’t bout shit)
Let him know I got this
Now when he call, her phone say "Side Bitch"
Tell him I say Got em
Tell him I say Got em, I got em, I got em, I got you, I got you
I got you, girl I got you
She's gone
And you ain't gotta worry cause I got you (she's gone)
And you ain't gotta worry cause I got you (she's gone)
Fuck him, I got you, you got me, Got em1Embed
