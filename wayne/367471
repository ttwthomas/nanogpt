1 ContributorSong Cry Lyrics
Letz go boy...clap ya hands...

Man, i make the bitches say...weezy make the hoes go..
And throw they W's up and say.....Young

If you know somebody hotta than me
You don't know shit
Little whizzle wee, bitch i'm focus man
See i got it slammed on the pokeys
Watch i make my top disappear..hocus pocus
Wait a minute...
I'm fucked up cause i can't get over somethin'
But is it me or is my Bentley super sick on them buttons
And i'm stunt'n in the dirty south
We bang out..if you think itz a game when them thangs all out
And i... aim at cha frame when them thangs drawn out
And i....rang at cha brain
I flip it when it come them flames
And maann..ain't it a shame
When ya names called out
Fee got u on the news wit cha remains all out
Ayy. ..the boy Wayne ball out
My paper bigger
I even got a few hundreds wit Franklin's baby pictures
I'm a it take there wit u
U bitch u
Weezy the official..S-Q-A-D

I'm the son of the stunna baby
I stunts baby
I get it up it up front in lumps every month baby
I get enough cutz from slutz
So can u suck baby
I piss so much nut
I got bitches coughin' up babies
My Bentley my baby
I make her climb over humps
Wit her size 20 pumps baby
Ice chunks in my fronts when i grunts baby
And chickens cluck
I pluck for free
But all i want iz B
I leave blood over beats
Cause my heart speaks
I seek guns if i beef...beef beef son
If i beef 3 come
If i beef..gotta keep my heat tugged in the crease
Cause i reached my peak young in the streets
I thug in the streets
Hataz chew lead
Understand i got big boy bread
I leave crumbs you can eat
I leave tiger streaks
Where i spun in the streets
W-E-E-Z-Y WEE

People you are observin' 5 even honies
So look at me different
See me in the mean Lamborghini...look at me dimpin'
See me wit a queen on my wing....look at me pimpin'
Look at me wrong you dead.....wrong
The lead music to my ears
Make me pump it to ya headphones
Take a liter black, this nigga wit red bones
I gets my bread on
I'm 19 with them 20's, but i'm a 100% up in the red zone
I know the feds on
Every since i copped that house and them two Bentleys
The good is in me, the hood is in me
Thats why every other 16, i scream 17
I got bling heavily
Greasin' things glittery
Interbeam and get inbetween and u sleepin' in misery
Look at what the game did to me
Therez gangsta in every bit of me
FAT!!!
