9 ContributorsWayne & Mack’s Ho Story (Skit) Lyrics
Heey!
So this a story. I had a broad and umm, you know Mane called me to the room. He got something so fine she got on a Apple bottom shirt, I don't even know what her pants was. She jumped on stage and served me on stage on "I'm way more fly than you". Yea so you know, Mack Mane call me on some Hollygrove shit, he was like come down holla at ya boy. So I come down, he got her in the bed with just pumps on, the Apple bottom shirt and drawers on. Mind you she's a stallion, she gotta weigh like 250 pounds, all fine-ness. So look she laying in the bed just playing, looking. I come in the room, how I come in the room Mack? I don't wana lie to these bitches, how I come in?

He come in there with the, what we smoke dutches, phillys shit like that. He come in there with that shit in his mouth, puffin' that good, with a bottle of Moet, ya heard me. So I'm like Tune, oh wait y'all don't know about that, keep that on the tuck. I said Weezy F. Baby! I said, what's happening wit you round? I go to the bathroom right quick, I like to take a piss before I get right, ya heard me. So I go to the bathroom, I come back out, this man here smoking a 'gar, hitting a bottle slow strokin' fast stroke. I'm like look at lil Tune go man! This nigga a fool out here huh! Maaaan! And he's dougie-ing, for those of you that seen Paid In Full, ya heard me. He dougie-ing homie, Dougie Fresh

He ain't even seen I put my leg up I was like throw that ass back! I bust, she ran behind me after I bust! I sat down in the bathroom, damn. I don't never get hard after I bust, I can't do that shit, some shit I just can't do. She done it, for me. That night. Within a second!You might also likeEmbed
