48 ContributorsRolls Royce Weather Every Day Lyrics
I sip drank with my dinner, smoke some gas before breakfast
Bitches know my name and I don’t have to wear a necklace (2 Chainz)
Bought a Wraith for Winter and a vert for the Summer
'Member twelfth grade I sold some work to undercover
Mama only child we stayed in a one bedroom (tru)
Used to ride MARTA ‘cause it had more leg room
I'm a ghetto boy, I came up on Brad Jordan
First lick I made, I bought five pairs of Jordans
Make it so bad, two pair were the same
I see the old me in new cats in the game
Drop some loose change on some clothes I can't pronounce
Gun so muhfuckin' big you gotta crouch
I like pretty girls with some business about theyself
Bring your best friend, you don't need nobody else
All about that mula, Netflix, and the Moscato
In my sex drive, I ride over potholes

I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday

I just got a text message from wifey, nigga
I scroll down, the next message from Nike, nigga
I’m just doing it too big on these tiny niggas
I been lost my fuckin’ mind, I never mind these niggas
Pockets deep and I’mma get in depth like like Johnny nigga
Acting like they on the edge, I’m a step behind these niggas
Outthink, outshine these niggas
Eyes chink like Chinese niggas
Fast lane, fast life, you blink you probably miss us
You thinking 'bout your missus
I'm thinking about my missions
We think you outchea snitching, that’s why we ‘round here whispering
I think my palms are itching, I think my bomb is ticking
I keep that Maggie on me, I think I'm Homer Simpson
Money over bitches, should be a Bible scripture
Bitches, hoes, and women, I don’t know the difference
All I know is this shit, I don’t owe them bitches
I do me and love it, Lord I done overdid it

I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday

All I know is this shit, I don’t owe them bitches
I do me and love it, I done overdid it
I don’t owe them niggas, I don’t owe them niggas
I do me and love it, I done overdid it14Embed
