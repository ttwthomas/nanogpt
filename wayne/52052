14 ContributorsSpit In Your Face Lyrics
Αy yo oo ohh (ohh)
Ay yo oohh (ayy)
Ay yo oo ohh
So I’mma spit in your face

Uh, straight off the bat
I come straight off my back with a gun like I’m in Iraq
And in fact I attack and tackle, and sack and crack and crack ‘em
And snap back and battle my own shadow cause ya’ll wack and all that
Bullshit you're talking startin to get funky
Toss me the chunky, I’ma brew these punkies
Stir I’m from the block but you don’t pass like a flunky
We make a bitch a mule and everybody act a donkey
Yes, I want you to come around here with that plan boy
I’ll shoot this mutherfucker til I burn my hand boy
Bust up in the court and shoot the witness on the stand boy
This is my game ask everybody in the stands boy
I’m all red I’m on fire like a ant pile
They put the clamp down if I put the stamp down
You get the stampede, I make blood bleed
You suck dick, I succeed

Yeah, yeahhh, and this is how victory tastes
So I’ma spit in your face

Ay yo oohh (ayy)
Ay yo oo ohh
So I’mma spit in your face
Singing ay yo oo ohh (oohh)
Ay yo oohh (ayy)
Ay yo oo ohh
So I’mma spit in your face

If this is a race I ain’t going for no place I am going for your place
While you are home, how you gon’
Fuck with me if I ain’t fuckin’ around
2 eyes to the sky, 10 toes touching the ground
Bitch nigga I am not your homeboy
We are not from the same home boy
My Nina Baker bring your joy
I’ll destroy who you employ
I shoot 12 rounds, now Jr. Jones Roy
Y’all so backwards, I don’t do Backwoods, I’ma swisher man
8 in the morning you bouta get found by a fisherman
Yeaa, You guys is bitches, little girls
And Mr. Smith & Wesson wanna kiss your pussy pearl
Tongue kiss an angel and spit fire at the devil
And I do whatever for the root of all evil
Gold, silver, bronze, no try the black medal
Turn your motherfucking flowers to feathers now fly to heaven
Kevin!

So I’mma spit in your face
Singing ay yo oo ohh (oohh)

So I’mma spit in your face

And crazy’s what they're calling me
But crazy isn’t hardly what I am
Try creatively retarded I'm amazingly rewarded
Ain’t no faith in me the hardest never crack, I’m crack
I’m dope in Reynolds Wrap, now let’s just hope you get it back
Let’s just hope that you get it
And if I have anything to do with it, motherfucker I did it
Yeah, Young Tune, guerrilla monsoon
Mr. Martian will hang your ass from the moon
'Cause you don’t get sun, you just get it soon
Turn your I.D. to a tomb
Goons R Us, the food's for us
We eat with our hands, no fork and spoon for us
We will take the knives, and we will take the wives
And we won’t take the jewelry but we will take the lives
Yeah
And I'm no pig
But I'm the hog spitting in your face
So I’ma spit in your face

Singing ay yo oo ohh (ohh)
Ay yo oohh (ayy)
Ay yo oo ohh
So I’mma spit in your face
Singing ay yo oo ohh (oohh)
Ay yo oohh (ayy)
Ay yo oo ohh
So I’mma spit in your faceEmbed
