15 ContributorsI Hate Love Lyrics
She was the sweetest ever
Whatever happened to forever
She never say never, she rather say whatever
I’d rather stay together and she’d rather chase the devil
Now I’m left to race the rebel
Bartender make it several
Turn up the bass and treble
How bout I make it metal
I’m such a fatal fellow
And shes the reason why
Because without the muthafucker I’d die
I’d die, I’d die
So bury me today or tomorrow
Cause I’ve buried myself away
In the sorrow in May
I die before I wake
I pray I’m resurrected for her nightmares sake
But you love me
At least thats what she said
That whole weekend in my bed
But there was a speaker in my head
Saying “seek and you’ll be led”
But instead, instead I loved you
I was weak and mislead
I was deeper than dead
I was sinking in dread now I’m thinking in shreds
So I inked this in red
You might also likeBut she loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love

I used to tell myself I wouldn’t do this to myself
Until I proved it to myself
And now I’m losing myself
I used to have my shit together but now
You see now, I with whatever
And now, you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever
And everybody know I ain't acting like I’m supposed
I’m attacking my own soul
I’m back in a lone mode
I’m back on that long road
And that road goes forever and ever
I don’t wanna love no more, spare me
You can have my heart its only dead beat
I’m sick of the love songs and the bullshit
When reality bites like a wolf bitch
She’s on top, she wanna kiss
She won't stop, she don’t wanna quit
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever
She loves me, she loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love
And I don’t want love, I don’t want love
I don’t wanna love no more
So if you see her you can have her
She’ll be outside my door
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor
I curse the very day you were born
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I’m guilty7Embed
