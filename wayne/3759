11 ContributorsToo Hot Lyrics
I duck off, cause the law lookin' for B.G
Sayin that I killed a nigga around the club last week
Left the scene ridin' in a big body
So I flipped the script now I'm in a ES3
Playin' by different bitches 'cause my face in the paper
Hoe drove by fore' she could describe me, I got the eraser
I don't discriminate I flip a bitch too
She got to be eliminated, I kill a bitch too
She her hair fixed by my sister she lost she gonna get her
To let me drop her off by this nigga, off the river
She ridin' with me thinkin' that it's cool and shit
She don't think I know that she let her lips loose and shit
I'ma pull over pull her out and pop some slugs in the bitch
And leave her pussy stinkin' 'cause I don't love a bitch
But I was taught comin' up, never trust a bitch
And don't hesitate for a minute to chug the bitch
She was tryin' to get me locked up
It was a must that the ho get popped up
Fuckin with me best believe that I'll cool ya block
Got ya sayin' them Hot Boy niggas too, too hot, too, too hot

What do ya call a nigga that be duckin' the law? (Hot)
What do ya call a nigga that be playin' it raw (Hot)
What do ya call a nigga that don't give a fuck who you are (Hot)
What do ya call a nigga that play it like Escobar (Hot)
(Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot)

Lil One gone
Lil one was stuck in this shit
Lil One say he gonna bust a nigga head if you fuck with his bitch
Lil One got the court hot
Lil One got the dough bar in front of your mama house up in your block
Lil One got the 44 cocked
Lil One got them calicoes
Lil One ain't even got no pops
So Lil One don't give 'em no props
Lil One make em timber
Lil One got a bad temper
Lil One killed that boy in November
Lil One be hustlin'
Lil One be thuggin'
Lil One doesn't wanna come up from nothin
I know Lil One ain't gonna stop
I know Lil One ain't gonna let a nigga run him off the block
Lil One kind of remind me of me
Man Lil One a G
Lil One runnin' with the big boys
Lil One fuckin these hoes
Lil One got some of these old niggas rolled
Lil One makin' his G's
Lil One runnin' them Keys

Lil One got twenty inches on his ride
Lil One got two calls for fives
Lil One don't give a fuck if he die or not
Lil One said if it jumpoff he gonna ride for his block
