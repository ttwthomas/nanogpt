5 Contributors4 Tha Haters Lyrics
I never gave a fuck about a bitch, and never will
Come to seperate the fake from the motherfuckin real
 get crazy and stupid
I shoot him straight through the heart like I'm related to Cupid
The federals trail me, but they can't feel me
I'm a picture not a poster, ma they can't nail me
Whatever they tell me, I won't hear it
Even when I die, they gon see my spearet
So  less than you fear it
Should view it from a far, don't you come near it
And I hear them niggas poppin they jaws
Got pussy full of cock in my drawers
Whatever, nigga

See me in the streets, you can hollar, I'm cool
And if it's bout dollars, Imma hollar at you
If it's about your woman, you can hollar at Boo
 got through
We had a blast, don't need a mask to do what I gotta do
Cause I want the next niggas to know what I'll probably do
And I want my next niggas to blow, so I got the crew
It's Young Money motherfucker, 
 is the building, Cash Money the roof
And Weezy Baby in the building, and I'm running it too
I hear you  niggas run in here too
Get yourself some money
