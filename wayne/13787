34 ContributorsGimme That (Remix) Lyrics
Woo
(Storch!)
What it is, folk? Oh
This right here is the sixteen-year-old phenom, Chris Breezy (S. Dot)
Ooh, woah
Me, myself, I'm the twenty-three-year-old CEO, oh, who?

Young Carter, harder than them other boys (Yeah)
I ain't even frontin', baby, I could take a summer off (Yeah)
I could break a woman off (Yep), I could take the stomach off (Yeah)
One of my trucks, now I'm ridin' in the goods (Oh)
Line it on up, guarantee you get served (Yeah)
Lil' Chris, said run it, so I ran and told her (Oh)
I'm a Cash Money youngin', Birdman Junior
Just a president, lookin' for a moniker (Yeah)
Chris Brown is in the building

The young boy just turned sixteen and I got (Uh)
Six four's and hot bikes that I rock (Uh)
Keep three or four sweeties on my clock (Uh)
But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop (Uh)
'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk (Uh)
That sassy tempo with that walk (Uh)
May be the reason that all these teenies may never see me
See Chris Brown LiveGet tickets as low as $58,500You might also like
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

Ma, take a break, let me explain to you (Woo)
What your body got a young boy ready to do (Woo)
If you take a chance to let me put them thangs on you
I could show you why I make them straight A's at school
I'm a hustler, trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes
In the coupe, with you on the phone screaming my name (Chris!)

Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that, hot)
You be talking like you like what I got (Yeah, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" (Oh)
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Hot, gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Hey, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac (Ooh)
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" (Ooh, oh)

Okay, Weezy baby, baby, what it do? I'm tryna holla at cha (Yeah)

You rockin' with young Chris and the best rapper (Yeah)
So leave your phone, bring your friends, let the rest happen (Yeah)
A lil' Patrón, a lil' Hen', I'm on Cavalli vodka (Check)
I'm in Cavalli jeans (Check), got on Cavalli boxers (Check)
I'm fresher than a newborn (Yeah, yeah)
And um, I can work you out like a futon (Yeah, yeah)
And um, you can leave your birthday suit on (Yep)
I'ma leave my boots on (Yep), I'ma leave my jewels on (Yep)
Never know what you want (Haha), I'ma leave that tool on (Yeah)
Never know who home, I learned that from a Biggie song (Yeah)
On to a new one (Come on), some like a redbone (Yeah)
Ooh, I think she like me, she got me on a ringtone
And I told her, "Get yours, girl, and don't you stop"
Now gimme that funk, that gushy stuff (Oh! Yeah)
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Three years older, gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Oh, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" (You could be in the back, yeah)
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Ooh, gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Yeah, gimme that)
