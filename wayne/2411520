10 ContributorsLA Traffic Lyrics
Girl you motherfucking unbelievable
A nigga wrong I can't believe it
Girl your shit feel like an achievement
We gambling with love let's break even
Now it's fuck every bitch I was ever seen with
She say I fucked every bitch I was ever seen with
That don't mean shit
She said she don't want it if ain't that routine dick
She said if you think them hoe's bad you ain't seen shit
Queen shit, upgrade
Got a nigga paying attention to her ass
All my other hoes feel underpaid
I said fuck that nigga you got rid off
Take that fucking shit off
Yeah, if we get cancelled we deserve a spin off
Quiet baby, thin walls, thin walls

And I told her you can listen to this shit when you're mad at me
Listen to this shit when you're mad at me
Cause all of this lovey-dovey shit I'm bad at it
All that lovey-dovey shit I'm bad at it
You can listen to shit, don't be mad at me
Listen to this shit, don't be mad at me
A nigga on his way baby bad traffic
A nigga on his way baby bad traffic, uh
You might also like
Girl where you goin', where you comin' from
I could take you places you ain't been before hoe
You make them hoes go back in they pigeon holes
I turn all of my stressing to mistletoes
Girl you just perfect
Motherfuckin' centerfold
Girl you just perfect
She said it is what it is and you get what you give man
Don't you love reimbursements?
Girl you just perfect
I dream about how beautiful you are
And you look way better in person
Girl you just perfect
You make me a better person
If you leave I'll report a missing person
She's too real
Woo

Shit is that real
And I told her you can listen to this shit when you're mad at me
Listen to this shit when you're mad at me
Girl cause all of this lovey-dovey shit I'm bad at it
Girl all that lovey-dovey shit I'm bad at it
You can listen to shit, don't be mad at me
Listen to this shit, don't be mad at me
Girl, a nigga on his way baby bad traffic
Girl, a nigga on his way baby bad traffic
Whoever told you shit was easy they was lying to ya
Let me spit mine to ya
I told them other bitches that I'm signed to ya
I go the whole nine with ya
Fuck 'em
Girl I think the world of ya
I hope the world ain't coming to an end
Why you outta breath?
She said I just ran from a man I ain't tryna run into again
I ain't none of them other niggas
I ain't none of them other niggas
She said fuck that shit I'm done with niggas
Broke down right in front of a nigga and asked me if I understand
Girl I see what you mean with tunnel vision
And I must be a sucker for her
Fuck it I'm a sucker for her
But I can make her jump for joy
Make a bunch of noise
Leave the city for a country boy

And I told her you can listen to this shit when you're mad at me
Listen to this shit when you're mad at me
Cause all of that lovey-dovey shit I'm bad at it
She said fuck love Tune, I wan' get mad handled
Girl you just perfect
You can listen to shit, don't be mad at me
Listen to this shit, don't be mad at me
A nigga on his way baby bad traffic
A nigga on his way baby bad traffic
You can listen to this shit when you’re mad at me
Listen to this shit when you’re mad at me
Cause all that lovey-dovey shit I’m bad at it
All that lovey-dovey shit I’m bad at it
You can listen to this shit, don’t be mad at me
Listen to this shit, don’t be mad at me
A nigga on his way baby bad traffic
A nigga on his way baby bad traffic
