17 ContributorsJet Life (Remix) Lyrics
Don’t miss this jet ho
Don’t miss this jet ho
Don’t miss this jet ho
Don’t miss this jet ho
Talking jet life to the next life
Jet life to the next life
Jet life to the next life
Jet life to the next life

Hood niggas they die young
Real niggas they die rich
Life's a slut, dirty ho
Either way I can't bitch
Kick back with 3 females
Pouring shots in front getting details
Said presidents in that presidential
Big face and that's detail
Whole thing that's wholesale
Kush louder than a doorbell
Popped up in your town
With the whole floor of the hotel
Trump Towers I'm sky high
One wish I die high
Gold casket when they carry me
Don't cry when they bury me
Foreign whips got no tops
Louis loafers got no socks
Can't sleep without the cameras on
Under both pillows got both Glocks
Condo's on top floors
Back shots best sex ho
G4's on runways
Don't miss this Jet ho

Top of the morning
I'm on top at the moment
I kick the industry door in
I made a way for my homies
A couple sucker niggas supposedly plotting on me
Not felons, more phonies
Not beef that's more baloney
No time to spend on it
I'm out chasing this money
No time for them monkeys
More Sosa, less Tony
Your girl want hop on it
Can't hide I bet she want it
Ferrari 599 bitch want ride my pony?


Prepare for takeoff
Young Money in the front like the pace car
Young Tunechi I got the blunt I need a copilot
Throwing snitches off the plane they going skydiving
Yeah, I'm at a skateboard session
Bitch I be so high I can meet George Jetson
Hoes in the cockpit, wearing trukfit
Jet life no turbulence
