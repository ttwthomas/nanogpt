95 ContributorsBed of Lies Lyrics
Oh-oh-oh, yeah

Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, "This nigga buggin'"
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
You might also like
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies414Embed
