5 ContributorsRide Out Lyrics
Hot Boys and you know how we ride out
Philly Boys and you know how we ride out
Hot Boys, Philly Boys 'bout to squad out
Ride out, crash niggas hideouts
Hot Boys and you know how we ride out
Philly Boys and you know how we ride out
Hot Boys, Philly Boys 'bout to squad out
Ride out, crash niggas hideouts

Guerilla Warfare nigga what ain't no beef
Here come them boys masked up bout to flame yo street
You heard that it game now look we H-O-T
We ride in wars if we beef then we playin' for keeps
What you ain't found out 'bout us
Cash Money Millionaires slash night riders
We keep it real wit' each other, we don't fuck wit' outsiders
Nigga if you run up on me you'll catch 50 out a chopper
Now blocka! Let 'em burn
Dump him off in a lake and have his family concerned
Then run all in his house and take his money and his children
Wodie my click balled up, do or die niggas
Disagree wit' us it's straight suicide nigga
It's a suicide, it's a suicide
Nigga act like they don't know about you and I
Who am I? The BG
Who are you? Lil Weezy
Who we be? The HB's
Where we from? U.P.T

These niggas never thought they'd be the ones that Mil'd shake down
Get a few crack spots, sell that big weight now
But when you ree up you to cut yo cake now
And when you see murder you know you got to break down
Y'all bitch niggas thinkin' life is a cut
Now you stuck watchin' niggas fuck your wife in the butt
You was the main thug up in the club
Now you the main thug sucking a snub
Gettin' baptized in your tub
I kick murder every two bars
Pack two tars, when I cock I need two cars
Cause I stuff a trunk like a turkey
Keep a vest on, that deuce-deuce ain't gone hurt me
When I get the drop I'll pop while y'all sprayin'
Wit' the calico box full of bald heads, got y'all scared
Then hit the block for y'all bread
Cause when y'all post up I'm leavin' y'all dead, leavin' y'all dead

You know Mac, that Philly cat with the official flow
The pistol will blow, especially if your wrist on glow
Rocks in the watch looking like a disco show
Grab the tool-a, put it to the back of your medulla
Beanie Sigel desert eagle quick to pop off ten
I only carry guns that knock off limbs
Give out colostomy bags, lay on the deck when I spray on your set
Who you know escapin' the TEC without a trach' in they neck
I roll with killers and dealers who be supplying the packs
I'm a guerrilla, but you can catch me where the lions be at
It ain't shit for me to ride out and tie a few cats
Make them show me where they hide out and their valuables at
You can catch me in the kitchen 'bout to break up somethin'
Large block, coffee pot 'bout to bake up somethin'
When I'm broke, you can catch me about to shake up somethin'
Wit that Colt four-pound that'll wake up somethin'
Hot Boys and you know how we ride out
Philly Boys and you know how we ride out
Hot Boys, Philly Boys 'bout to squad out
Ride out, crash niggas hideouts
Hot Boys and you know how we ride out
Philly Boys and you know how we ride out
Hot Boys, Philly Boys 'bout to squad out
Ride out, crash niggas hideouts1Embed
