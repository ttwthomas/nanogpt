2 ContributorsThis Girl Lyrics
Who da hell is dis girl
Da club so packed but I
Gotta get 2 dis girl
She right there but it's like she's cross da world
Im tryin 2 approach her why she dancing on da vip sofa
Then she disappears
Who da hell is dis girl
Da club so packed but I
Gotta get 2 dis girl
She right there but it's like she's cross da world
Im tryin 2 approach her why she dancing on da vip sofa
Then she disappears oooooo

Ur man got the debs
On how mami lives
Man she da shit
Word up
She got her own crib with her own bricks
She know how to whip
She got a funny rhyme with a nice hook
She know how to spit
She got a big gun with a big clip
She know to hit
I wanna lick her toes, wanna lick her chest
Wanna lick for lips
Muah, gotta give her kiss
Cuz I know dat she taste good (good) like
'Donalds french fries
She taste like 'Donalds french fries
But its hard to get to her
Like she took both the wings
Off the V & the flying spur
I can see her plain as day
Cuz the light off the chain
Make her light like she on the stage
I gotta get to her
But I can ne-ne-never reach her
You might also like

Ooooooooo she was fly
But I was lookin at her shoes
Da louis vuttons & I was watchin every move
The birkin bag & she was workin the swagga
& I said lil mama can I get at you? (What did she do?)
She rolled her eyes like she was playin
So hard to get (What you do?)
Said to myself she ain't seen the hard top yet (Then what?)
I ain't come with no chauffeur
Its jus me in the roadster
& I said lil mama can I get at you (What she say?)
Then she said that she dont do rappers
I replied that I can be a chiropractor
Better yet I could a contractor
Get up in the buildin tear walls down
You can line them up & I'll tear all down
Tried to get the numba but then she di-di-disappeared in the crowd


She got that long hair, she booku fine
I got that long hair, I let her pull mine
She got them pretty feet, nice smile
She lookin' at me with them light browns
We in the back seat, but the chauffeur missin
She got them fat cheeks call that ass Oprah Winfrey
It smell like potpourri, yeah that pussy great
And shawty body shaped like a figure 8
She 'bout to get ate 7,6,5,4,3,2,1
And I won't stop until she cum
And I just mop up with my tongue
Oh. oh my what a night ima wake up in the morning like
Who the hell is this girl?
