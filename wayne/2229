Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

And I'm a star
Yea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like hammers home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong
Oh, but you right if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on but you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra
I'm so not sober, I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller
Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know and did you know
I'm the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn
Like a dead body burned on the mantle piece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze
Defrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne, don't make me none
So that's why I got a pre-nup
I do

Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

Yeah, Yeah
A is for Adamsville
B is for Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her, leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her, let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your undivided attention, I'm
Gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three fourth of it all
For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? Get, get, get, get, get on your knees
'Cause wealth is the word
Rich is round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird
(Starts off)
Tenth grade, the way was paved for me and Dre to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein of arts and crafts
Now could we make ah a difference
Antwan Patton and André Benjamin
Been jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Part two the sequel all new 'Kast
Just ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name behind that screen name
They're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen
(Nigga please)
But even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting

Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce
I do, love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, it's game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her for all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share and take you there
And me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walked a thin line
Others say they got you but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence — is that right?
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me, need me, dress me
Now it's so messy straight cut out and left me

Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talkin' about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over
But it's cool
We just keep it goin' and make new shit
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang13Embed
