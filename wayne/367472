Ay, take a real good look
At the boy and tell me if u see as much gangsta
As i feel. Cause that there is all i can be, that there
Iz just me, man. W-E-E-Z-Y Wee

Wayne deep in the Grova
Out comes the small solja
Alcoholic doja, bother my composure
Oh lord, am i suppose to be this way
Do i live no good, this may be wrong but it feel so good
And far from home,i still feels so hood
I got the set on my belly
That shit gone be there til' a nigga barried
I ain't scary
Bring it, i'm ready
I be on them m terry's and them cranberry
Handle the whip ...like andrelly
And i handle a bitch like man Nelly
My nigga they go down down down baby
Til' i uh-oh
Ya know
I move a rainbow Lambo on momo's
Far as dope go i'm up like no do'
Bet i never sweat no hoe
I don't get no type of threat from no foe
I don't freat the popo's
Cause i don't respect the popo's
Many say that i poesess a dope flow
I accept..cause when i'm Weezy
I'm at my best
You might also like
...and even if i wanted to...i can't change...i'm gangsta...i say i'm gangsta...ya know

I ball hard like small guard
The small boy slidin' out a large toy
Me fall off , naw boy
I'm a stand thru it
The flo' deservin' obations
So clap ya hands to it
The flo' is real so ay man to it
Jam to it
Spendin' millions since Block is Hot
This is man music
Had pennies before Block is Hot
But this is grand music
Had blew because the fans than damn igloo it
And i ran the damn dick to ya peoples, people
Get mo' booty than Benzino singles
From bisexuals to bilinguals
After i sex u itz bye skeezer
And i'll see ya later, baby
I'm a player sorry...
..chrome wide..fee on the five g
I sit deep wit my heat just case sit get steep
Weezy a dirty south boy
I eat pig meat
I'm just me
4 real, i'm just me..man....

I probably never killed nobody
But i pointed my pistol
And those of you who i pointed it at
I'll still kill you
I still familiar with the hustle
I could go dope, weed, or coke
Bet i never see broke
And know who never, say never
But whatever
I never felt better than now
I'm 19, and i'm a veteran now
When i step out my house
I need weaponry now
U fuck around and i bet it bloaaa...
Yea..and they wonderin' how i get so rich as a child
Remember i wuz before Romeo and Bow Wow
Shit i had hoes way before Romeo and Bow Wow
But no disrespect, my daughter crazy bout'em
And notice how u notice therez nothing fake about me
Therez something great about me
I'm still young so therez plenty more to break up out of me
People brace ya' self
Place ya self in these 7 and halves
You don't know the half
Now tell me who can walk my path
Not a soul
The boy live his life on the edge
.....Geronimo
The edge....Geronimo...yea...
