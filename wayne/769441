Cut the music up in the head phones, please
That's more like it
Uh, uh, uh yeah
This that rock with me music, buck with me music
Baby come to my pad and f*ck with me music
F*ckin with me music, f*ckin with me loose your life
I would like to prove it but that's why I got gooned-ed
Ever since a junior, I've been on that bullshit
You don't have a fireplace? that's how hot your wood get
So santa come yo ass down the chimney
Behind my kids I leave your gift bag empty
Riff raff plenty, yeah that's what ya'll do
I got two tech nines should I text or call you
Muthaf*cka I kill all you, put the pump to your ear and
Pump up the volume, knock out a tall dude, bear hug a fat boy
I f*cked the teacher and stomp on the frat boy
I don't believe the preacher and I never been a choir boy
But my pockets do hit high notes like mariah boy
Yeah, I keep my angel low like maya boy
Then I pull it out and give you wings watch me flya boy
Used to be a hot boy now I'm fire boy
I'm talking fire, like rubbin cauduroy
Oops, I meant corduroy, carter boy, stuntin like my father boy
Flow like water boy, even though I got a voice like the boy on water boy
They pay a ton like my first name is walter boy
Sweetness, but see you'd rather 'nsult a boy
But I put that pimp in ya step like walter boy
Chuch, and weezy f's the alter boy
And yes I am a dog, now watch me cat-a-pul-ta boy
And yes I'm extra alter, yes a vulture, catch you walkin
Extra talkin to the morgue by extra coffins
Yeah I'm hype like my wife, man
Extra coffee, me and my wife be A Ok no time to shake them exes of me hah
What it is, I'm back on my biz'
And I put that on the threads on the back of my kids
May that that eleven be attached to my ribs
And the bullets that I give be attached to his
I'm back muthaf*cka, I'm that muthaf*cka
But besides barack I'm one hell of a black muthaf*cka
Ya digg? f*ck every fish in the river
I bet my love boat f*ck every fish in the river nigga
Yeah, when you in that trunk do you quiver nigga?
Cut the music up so we can't hear the nigga
Then we burn the car, with the nigga
Burn 'em so bad they can't tell if it is a nigga
We leave yo body lookin like a lizard nigga
My ma's a chef, do you wanna be for dinner nigga?
I'm at the finish like what's up with these beginner niggas?
I'm a winner nigga, but now and then a nigga
Shoutout to nas to help me tap into my inner nigga
And nigga or not, we are all sinners nigga
So please forgive me if I have to kill a nigga
And the president is still a nigga
