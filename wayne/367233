Haha Gutta Gutta Weezy we ready (uh huh)

I come through like move bitch get out tha way
'Fore I pull this Glock out and stick it dead in yo face nigga
A young wild nigga won't crack a smile nigga
I pull it out and start bustin' in tha crowd nigga
And I do it for my gangsta niggas
Don't give a fuck, run in tha club and bang a nigga
Shit, and look I keep it gangsta on tha regular
Stay in yo place Gutta 10 steps ahead of ya
