51 Contributors6 Minutes Lyrics
Yeah, I go by the name of Cassidy the Hustler
And I brought two of my niggas with me
And we about to shut the industry down
Ayo Weezy let's get it popping!

Hit me,  Fuck that shit this the south side
Got a fat dick when your mouth wide, in front then take it outside
Nah do it right here, nah, how 'bout later on
Yeah when everybody home
Look, you fucking with Weezy F baby, please say the baby
Riding with your bitch, got keys on the lady
Triple gold D's Vogue tires on the whip
Young Carter sliding out, I'm flyer than the whip
Yeah, higher than an angel, or hotter than the devil
The pot or kettle, uh
The metal let 'em burn like Ursher but worser
If there's any beef, I come Ron like Mercer
Word up, Eagle Street I'm throwing my curve up
We take your ice cream and turn you into Sherbert
I got flow I'm like "Sure" but
If it's about dough, I'm like "Sure 'nuff"
I'm from the bird bunch, Birdman Jr. you niggas bird lunch
I see your lips moving but I ain't heard much
You see the wrist moving, it look like pure punch
I hear the playa hating but I don't endorse such
I got the Escalade, guts like the tour bus
I got the Styrofoam poured up with syrup
And in the tires where the package is gone
Midas been a Goodyear with these Firestones
I spit like Maya's poems, palming chromers
For the buyers chromosomes I got soma's
I got Vicodin, Valiums I ain't stopping
Got powder, heroin, ex, Oxycontin
And that's how we rocking
How can you hear that bop unless I'm be-bopping?
Yeah, skip when you hear that click
Cash money, nigga, I'm that shit, Weezy Baby, ugh!
You might also like
That's what I'm talking about
Now Fab (yeah), spit at these niggas
And let them know why they ain't fuckin' with you

You're goddamn right I'm feeling myself
A chauffeur, no sir, I'm wheeling myself
Looking for a chick chilling for self
So I can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
I'm having problems dealing with wealth
But you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
You niggas must've got a deal for your health
Your CD is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
I spend big, at any time I can start splurging
The twin SIGs open chest like a heart surgeon
And I'm buttoned up, I'm just a blue-collar crook
But I keep a stack thick as few college books
I got a new polished look
And 20 dime bitches, to show y'all niggas how my 2 dollars look
The boy's got at least 6 digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like 10 bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers
The 2 grand 20's make the hustlers suffer
Plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm 'bout to throw some bullets past 'em
And the niggas in the hood keep quoting my lines
I don't jump ship, I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting, I'm fine
I'ma have these dick sucking niggas deep-throating the 9
I jumped in the English ship, Benzed in whip
It's Terminator 2 chrome, the engines dip
I'm reading scripts, no, not the penmanship (no)
The box-office shit (yeah), I box off this bitch (yeah)
Jessica Alba, Kirsten Dunst
And still make a mill' on the first of months
These dudes be the first to front
'Til their family and friends is in limos, they in hearse in front
I'm in the top position, I can make you a proposition
I'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
To hell with the patience
I'ma send a nigga down under like Australia vacations
Yeah, it is what it is
My niggas just killed y'all and I'ma close the casket

I'm trying not to let this industry get the best of me y'all
I work hard for the fame, the game's stressing me y'all
All they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
From the hood to Hollywood they respecting me y'all
And even overseas they accepting me y'all
All the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
I get a lot of dirty money so expect me to ball
But I'm saving all my checks, I'm investing 'em all
They say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall
Even the stars, but success is my destiny y'all
Look, I cook tracks I got the recipe y'all
You can't name another cat that can mess with me y'all
At the shows all the hoes be molesting me y'all
I got broads crying trying to get next to me y'all
I got broads craving begging to have sex with me y'all
Screaming, "Cass you don't know how sexy you are!"
And I'm happy I'm alive, God's blessing me y'all
And all the problems that arrive is God testing me y'all
So I pray everyday but I ain't praying too much
'Cause I be sinning everyday so I ain't praying enough
And we all could be beat, and I ain't saying I'm tough
But if it's beef I don't speak, I ain't saying "What's up?"
If it's beef when we meet then I'm spraying shit up
Prraat prraat, I ain't saying too much and that's that
'Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat 'cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
'Cause the folks you call friends tend to envy the most
Some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
Burn the bridge and don't give 'em a boat, let 'em sink
Sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
But sometimes you gotta give 'em the 9 and let 'em stink
You can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut, them niggas'll ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die but, I ain't ready to leave
That's why even if it's petty I'll be ready to squeeze
But put a cheddar in cheese, the guac-a-moola
I pop the Ruger, send that hot shit through ya
Like booya! That's the sound when the pound busting
Ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
Clown it's nothing to pull out and blast you
I try to only resort to violence if I have to
But man niggas out here are playing fair
So before the odds even I'm leaving them laying there
And I ain't even playing believe what I'm saying here
'Cause before this shit gets further your click get murdered
And thrown in a hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role I'll stomp a mud hole in yo' ass
And this Cass, nigga, I'm that sick
Full Surface nigga, I'm that shit, bitch!6Embed
