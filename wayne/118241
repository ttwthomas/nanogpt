33 ContributorsBullet Wound Lyrics
It's Guwop
Four numbers
Yeah

Gucci Mane LaFlare
Millionaire but don’t give no care
Tote my pistol anywhere
Go to war with a grizzly bear (Huh)
Burn yo' house with yo' kids in there
Called the folks, I had mid in there
A-K and my Sig in there
Drop-top V12 cylinder (Go!)
Your girl never had Christian Louboutins
So I bought her a pair
Really, it’s not an affair
'Cause she fucked a millionaire (Huh)
Mack-10, with a coolant, fool
These fuck niggas with bullet wounds
Extensions hanging out my britches
You can see this from a distance
I got Bloods and Crips with thirty clips
Fresh-ass nigga with a dirty pistol
I’m the same nigga that fucked yo' sister
You so broke, can’t buy no pistol (Damn)
I’ll buy yo' bitch, I’ll buy yo' life
Don’t no one but yo mama miss yOU (Wow)
Every day, I’m on drive, nigga
Never catch me in neutral
I ain’t doin' nothing in reverse
I wear Louie shoes, nigga, not Converse (Louie)
This concert is my convert
Got the right plan but the wrong person
I got yellow gold, I got rose gold
I got pink diamonds like Starburst (Brr!)
I don’t rehearse, I don’t plan first
I need a strong hook, I call the right person
You might also like
Yellowbone, butt-naked
If the pussy wack, eject it
Man, all my hoes be actin' like detectives
But I don’t give a fuck and if I did, I would give it to you
That rainbow hair is two colors, rhythm and blues, yeah
I just sold Father Time a time zone
They say we runnin' out of time
Tell that to a time bomb, yeah
Then she kiss me on my bullet wound
Who are you? 'Cause motherfucker, I’m me, fuckin' right
And if she say she catching that nut, I throw a strike
I can’t believe it's butter, go get my butter knife
Shoot a nigga twice in case he live a double life
Lil Tunechi, yeah

Shawty pussy wet (Wet), the dope dripping wet (Wet)
I live a double life, I got a stupid dumb check (Dumb check)
I do the shit that rappers do without a rap check (Nah)
I shit on hoes & pour up foes, I got street respect (Street)
I hit you with that carbon, you won’t live a double life (Nah)
I hit two niggas last week
So I got double stripes (I got double stripes)
Foreign bad bitch and she fuckin' on sight (Yeah)
I go Hublos, I got Rollies, I got ice on top of ice
Yellowbone, butt naked
If the pussy wack, eject it
Man, all my hoes be actin' like detectives
But I don’t give a fuck and if I did, I would give it to you
That rainbow hair is two colors, rhythm and blues, yeah
I just sold Father Time a time zone
They say we runnin' out of time
Tell that to a time bomb, yeah
Then she kiss me on my bullet wound
Who are you? 'Cause motherfucker, I’m me, fuckin' right
And if she say she catching that nut, I throw a strike
I can’t believe it's butter, go get my butter knife
Shoot a nigga twice in case he live a double life
Lil Tunechi, yeah6Embed
