Work hard, play hard (x4)
Work (x8)

I say suckas all in my lane nigga
Yo ain't got dough thats some change nigga
Murcielag’ got Georgia plates got no brains insane nigga
Matter of fact, it’s schizo, bad bitch she a thick ho
Hit the club go sicko, no ass shots she a sick ho
Every night it’s champagne nigga
Key to life maintain nigga
Nothing change but the change nigga
What way of key my cain nigga
Came from slanggin' straight cane nigga
Young strappin like cane nigga
Certified can’t stand beside me
I’ll make you rappers look lame nigga
Ugh, bet a hundred racks I’ll bring a hundred straps
Move a hundred packs, 2 presidents, no ice in that
Cost a hundred stacks, ugh
I buy all the clothes, rock all my shows
Rock all the gold, fuck all the hoes, smoke all the dro, can’t ask for more

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I’m throwin’ mine
Cause my money long
The quicker you’re here
The faster you go
That’s why, where I come from, the only thing we know is
See Wiz Khalifa LiveGet tickets as low as $97You might also like
Work hard, play hard (x4)
Work (x8)

I be killing them hoes, lock me up for murder
Make that ass shake, shake it like it’s nervous
Lil Tunechi bitch, I’m high as Wiz Khalifa
I swallow that pearl, tongue like I’m having a seizure
And I work hard, go harder, no father, no problem
Send my crew at your neck, like a t-shirt with no collar
Ho Holler, I’m poppin, red bone, you perfect
But when her period down man that bitch a brand new person
We are all gifted people, just don’t open the gift too early
She on her knees waiting for that nut like a verdict
Ahh, work hard, play hard, my dick stay hard, but suck my skateboard!
Tunechi!

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I’m throwin’ mine
Cause my money long
The quicker you’re here
The faster you go
That’s why, where I come from, the only thing we know is
Work hard, play hard (x4)
Work (x8)

I be working, I be working
I be going to different countries, gettin' money
If it’s poppin’ I’m near it, I’ll make an appearance, they want me
If you smoke in my section its blunt free
Got my own shit, man ain't no one front me
Do a show spend it all on Givenchy
Drive my own shit, I’m up in the front seat
Like oooh, niggas talkin' what I might do
Niggas talkin' bout the new car
I’m in the Old Chavelle it’s light blue
Smokin' weed livin' like a star, work hard than you might too
I play hard cause my bank long, keep ya day job
Uhh, rich nigga cool dude, Rockstar like U2
Camo’s on, you too, 100 million views on Youtube
Private plane, we Vegas trippin’
With Mally Mall, Vegas strippin’
You goin' hard and you think of winnin'
We all can ball if you play position

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I’m throwin’ mine
Cause my money long
The quicker you’re here
The faster you go
That’s why, where I come from, the only thing we know is
Work hard, play hard (x4)
Work (x8)2Embed
