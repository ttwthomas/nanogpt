11 ContributorsClick Lyrics
Lately been killing the game, I feel like I am the one
With the waves, take a flight to the city I'm from
Still getting love in my town and you just get none
You be stressing out nigga, I just do this for fun
Every beat I rip, always make hits and another one
Never wasting time, I'm increasing my funds
Getting rich, can't be middle class, I feel like a bum
When you getting money, rain on chicks, call it you hun
I get the whole pod, you lazy niggas pick up the crumbs
Drive past the club flexing and these haters look stunned
And I'm just getting started, it's ironic, you dumb
You never did anything with your life, you dun
Getting buzz, making noise like the beat of a drum
Drum making hits after hits, you can tell I'm on a run
Text me the ox, got fire hotter than a sun
Niggas wanna be down with the shits
They can never be a part of the click, lil nigga

You tryna be all in the mix, you can never be a part of the click
You tryna be all in the mix, and you ain't never been down with the shits
Boy you tryna be all in the mix, you can never be a part of the click
You tryna be all in the mix, but you ain't never been down with the shits

Them things still on, what they going for?
I'm heavy in a couple cities, don't tell the informers
Chevy 16 inches, 10 switches
Drop top, old school, whole Tim bitches
Folding them riches, get both of them digits
No real nigga compared to Young
Nuts hung low, hoe prepare your tongue
Yeah the game been hurt and I'm the medicine
Ahead of them I aim then squirt at the rest of them
Motherfuck them, I'm the boy on fire like Carteroid
Repping the , I get money forever
I got 2 clips taped together
That's 100, whatever, loving the cheddar
Call me mozzarella, it's no sweat
I could hustle in the hottest weather
I'm Weezy fucking baby, lots of terror
P.S., a few shots to whoever, yeah

You tryna be all in the mix, you can never be a part of the click
You tryna be all in the mix, and you ain't never been down with the shits
Boy you tryna be all in the mix, you can never be a part of the click
You tryna be all in the mix, but you ain't never been down with the shits1Embed
