4 ContributorsPistol On My Side (Remix) Lyrics
Me and the twin ninas have menage ??
Pistol on my side, don't come at me sideways
When the 5 sprays, he paralyzed (Bye Legs)
Bust til' the Glock hot enough to cook fried eggs
Most niggas my age been stopped liking rap
When they found out them niggas rappin, ain't write them raps
And they ghost writer ain't write it, that nigga typed them raps
In his phone, text it to holmes and he recite them raps
But on any type of track, I go dummy on it
The game dumbin down cause a bunch of dummies doin it
My weed got somethin' funny on it..
It make you feel a lil weezy, so they spendin cash money on it
You see me baby out here chasin the check
But you can go from makin connects to makin collects
If you rappin,  hear me rap it..  it can make you depressed
Cause you tryna be street that don't make you the best
It's some shit holmes said I can't wait to address
I'm the greatest I should ghostwrite for Drake and Em next
I'm so nice I can make them upset, but I dont give a hell
Louder guns, longer clips, bigger shells
So the hole big as hell when I smoke shit
Ha, me if I let the tommy hit you, you a ghost bitch
I did my own remix cause this dope Swizz
I roast this, I can't wait to post this..... BARS

Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, leave a nigga on his side
Mr. Always High, but nigga, you can call me "Slime"

Drippin' Avianne, Fiji, I'm a water slide
Pockets fatter than a greedy nigga on a diet
Nina on my side, but she say you can call her "Nine"
Divas on my side, so many they could form a line
Strippers on my side and I got 'em performin' live
Hot girl in the bed and she prefer the warmer side
Pistol on my side, I'm talkin' 'bout the Army kind
Cita, that's my moms, only had her and father time
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear it harmonize
Numbers don't lie, the Number One Stun- never mind
Tunechi in this bitch, eyes lookin' like Konnichiwa
Swizzy on the beat, I'ma beat it like policia
Burr, burr, burr, man the Uzi needs speech lessons
Pistol in my briefs, you don't wanna get this brief message
Here we go, here we go
Oh, oh, y'all think it's a game (yeah)

Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, leave a nigga on his side
Pistol on my side, talkin' 'bout the Army kind
Pistol on my side, leave a nigga on his side
Swizzy on the beat, I beat your ass it like policia
Tunechi in this bitch, eyes looking like Konnichiwa
Pistol on my side, you don't want that thing to scream at ya
Laughin' when you die, boy, my pistol a comedian (brr)
Pistol on my side, now he lyin' like the media
Clips longer than encyclopedias, you're readin' 'em
Double barrel, long barrel, short barrel, medium (brr)
We ain't hittin' licks, we beatin' 'em and then repeatin' 'em
Sugar in the coffee, sugar in the Morphine
Sugar sweet codeine, it ain't purple, then I'm barfing
Gang ride or die, like we sittin' on Harley's (skrt)
Let the thing talk like it's sittin' on Maury (burr)
Good, good, too good, in my doobie, I can't be stressin'
Ugh, ugh, ugh, that bitch moody, you may leave a message
Plll-plll-plll to his chest, give him three presses
Pistol in my briefs, you don't wanna get this brief message
Here we go! Weezy!

Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job
Pistol on my side, trigger finger on the job2Embed
