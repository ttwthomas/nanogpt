12 ContributorsReppin’ My City Lyrics
I be reppin' my city, I be reppin' my city
I be reppin my city er er er'y night
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city, no one can do it better
I be reppin' my city, I be reppin' my city
I be reppin my city er er er'y night
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city, no one can do it better

Let the top back on the Chevy
Then I crank up the boom
Smell the Issey Miyake
Soon as I step in the room
Hundred thousand in jewels
That's a whole lotta moves
So what's a soldier to do
Standin' in his bloody boots
Yeah I'm fresh outta boot camp
Ain't gotta food stamp
Counterfeit bills will get you killed
Now where the goons at
It's poppin' in Opalocka, floppin' them candy paints
Chrome Daytons, 12 pack of 12s in the Seven-Tre
Still hustle everyday, Dade County be the place
Get murdered for a burger with a nickle-plated burner
Still burnin' rubber, bustin' rubbers
In these bitches, under cover
Tell the truth, I ain't a lover
But I fuck her like I love her

I be reppin' my city, I be reppin' my city
I be reppin my city er er er'y night
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city, no one can do it better

I be reppin' my city
I be grippin' them cities
I be flippin' them pennies
Turn 'em to good and plenty
I be strokin' that pussy
I be smokin' that kushie
I be flippin' them flounders
They be huntin' my bounty
I'm the face of the hood
Every place in the hood
Triple C's in there
Come get a taste of my hood
I'm the captain of the corner
Khaki's and Coronas
Now we gotta show 'em
So let's patch 'em up and blow 'em
Now, blow the dice, shake 'em
Roll 'em, don't throw 'em
Head crack, where it's at
Nigga show me somethin'
Out in CC, Opalock, Overtown, City by
You know how we get it Don
Nigga, that's how I bet a thou
Project Poe, I'm the project hoe
That means, every time I talk, the projects spoke
And we in the same struggle
So the projects know
Gotta million dollar profit
Singin' project notes
Just know

I be reppin' my city, I be reppin' my city
I be reppin my city er er er'y night
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city, no one can do it better

This what I'm talkin' 'bout right here Poe
Wherever I'm at, I'm good nigga, hood nigga
First sign of problems, eliminate
Wish a nigga would act
Like he can't have rappers slip out the boroughs
Rosero? With the word, roses hit your mirror?
Cartel represent us, center of the war zone
Super cats on the coupe, cover of the whole zone
Catch me in the Source, double XL rated
Next to million dollar Nextel
Workin', ain't trippin' other checks now
Super sells, so the pussy's platinum
Back to the basics
You in danger at 16 with the beam
One in the chamber aimed at that 0 7
Got the chopper close by
Head bussa from the Bronx
Rep my city every night
Hundred thousand worth of ice
Tight work, boy that's life work
Crystal clear starin' make your eyes hurt
Time for the new breed, Triple C
Custom cars and cycles
Psycho path for my math
Put my hand on the pipe torch
 X2
I be reppin' my city, I be reppin' my city
I be reppin my city er er er'y night
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city, no one can do it better

I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my block
I be reppin' my hood
I be reppin' the locks
Welcome to Dade County
This the bottom of the beaker
Where the beach is sexy blue
And the cocaine cheaper
High nine five nigga, let me ride
I'm in that dolphin-colored S5
Fire, look at me
I'm bouncin' with that chick
Got the grill out my left fold
See how now I live
Call me Mr. Stephon
I gotta plush seat from Ingo P
Just know I rep my city thru Miami's E
Yeah, I'm Miami's baby
Brisco to Opalocka, goon come save me

I be reppin' my city, I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin my city er er er'y night
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city, no one can do it better
I be reppin' my city, I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin my city er er er'y night
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city
I be reppin' my city, no one can do it better1Embed
