18 ContributorsGet Bizzy Lyrics
See you niggas killin' me man
Did you think I don't hear you talkin'?
Like "Why Wayne and Dram' workin'?
Didn't wayne dis Dram'?
Didn't dram' dis wayne?" (Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!)
See ya'll niggas just wait til I turn around then talk about me
Fool-ass niggas
But I'll do this for ya'll
Ya'll ain't learned that? HAHAHAHA

Weezy F. bitch, I'm tired of y'all hatin'
I know ya head hurtin', you Tylenol-takin' mothafuckers
I'm the man, just ask your old lady
Like a true gentleman, I'm after your lady
I'm a massacre waitin' to happen, fuck all this rappin', boy
I get to cappin', leave you with holes like a napkin, man
He gon need napkin, no a band-aid, no a damn grave
I am Rampage Jackson on a rampage, step in my cage
Picture on my page, printed in the best book
Come up out my left pocket with a left hook
Mama said knock ya out, money made me block ya out
I got the game on lock, and I lock ya out
My jewelery singin' like a opera house
I brought that drop-top Phantom of the Opera out
Yeah, "Get Silly," not stupid man
Never save a ho, she better ask Soulja Boy to Superman
You can bet when I sleep, I'm Poloed down, head to feet
Polo horses on my sheets, I get that from Pimp C
Tall cup of DJ Screw, sippin' on a pint of Big Moe
Sharper than a tack ho, you can keep the tic toe
Yeah, red scarf on my neck
Red diamonds lookin' like red barf on my neck, ugh
And to my Bs, nigga, "Soo-woo"
Cause I be with more Bs than Juju-
Big bro, I'm a big dog
And I don't mean fleas when I say I'm ticked off
Haha, nigga, I don't ever scratch
And if she throw that pussy, big dog fetch
Type of soldier on some sketch that shit
I'ma draw that pistol, make your chest a tablet
You are just a tad bit and I'm a whole lot
Young Money mothafucker, but the money so not
You might also like
It's Young Money, nigga!

Sick with' it, hard body like Iron Mike
The flow is C4, I drop bombs like dynamite
You niggas is sweet, yeah sweet like Mike'n Ikes
Bob Barker with the Phantom white, cause my price is right
Hit the club nigga, then I leave with' two dykes tonight
Let my niggas cut them up, they gon' get a slice tonight
Nigga peep my wrist game, you can see the ice is right
Blind everybody in this motherfuckin spot tonight
Superman, blowing on a Swisher full of kryptonite
Got the wolves with' me here, I'm howling in this bitch tonight
Niggas say they hard body, but I can't tell
Nigga, you can get yo shit cracked like a crab shell
You want war with' the boys, so be it
We in all red like the fuckin Soviet Army
Rush a bitch, nigga if he talking crazy
Hit him in his left leg, have him walking crazyEmbed
