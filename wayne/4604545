11 ContributorsBodies Lyrics
Yeah
I've been
I've been

I've been trappin' on the low low
Just me and my woe no
Bet the feds probably got a hunch like Quasimodo
Captain on my logo, that's me and my bro bros
Promethazine a no dose, a recipe for oh oh

Trapping out the 4-door, traffic moving so slow
I just come from cholo, cholo got that coco
My Iphone bout' to blow though
They looking for that coco
They know I got that coco
I'm never a no-show
I'm never with po-po
And it's always on the low-low
And it's always for the low-low
I look out for the poor folks
I'm sipped out I'm a slow 
I'm swagged out for the gold rope
I pull the cash out scream "yolo"
Till I get a sore throat nigga whoa whoa
I tell my hoe no before my woe woe
Fuck her till she scream "No more go slow"
I like when bitches scream "Go go go though"
And ride me lika a  Volvo
I got keys in this  Volvo
And I'm keeping a low pro fo' sure
I done made it to the money and it feel like Christmas
I tell a hoe "Ho ho ho"
You might also like
Been trapping on the low low
Just me and my woe no
But I bet the feds probably got a hunch like Quasimodo
Trapping in my Polo
Trapping in my Polo
Trapping in my Polo
Trapping in my Polo
Captain on my logo
That's me and my bro bros
Promethazine a no dose, recipe for oh oh
Promethazine I go pro, yeah I go pro
Promethazine I go pro, yeah

See round here you gotta mumble
Cause these hoes is like dumbo
Boy these hoes is cut throat
Stop talkin' when you cuddle
Hoe this ain't no love boat
Smoking like a tug boat
I get in the  and I go for the gun store
I go for the gun store
I don't fuck with young hoes
My bitch swallow cum though and even blow a bubble
I just be like encore
This shit is a blood sport
We shoot you in your muscles
And leave you like a puzzle
AK-47 and the nina has a couple
Numbers don't lie I shoot you a hundred times
Long hair don't care
Bitch it's Weezy not Rapunzel
I'm on these trees bitch swinging in the jungle
And I was born there like Tarzan
I was dealt the hard hand
But now they call me Starzan
And I just pop the bar exam
Penitentiary flow my bars hard
Too hard for a cell mate
So all these other fucking rappers to me ain't nothing but a jail bait
Too much coke make the skill shake
Too much coke make the skill shake
It's Lil Tune aka Jim
That's what they call you when you sell weight
The feds watching with a stale face
The hoes watching with the Yeah face
We fuck all night make up on the pillow
Wake up in the morning see a real face
Ben Franklin with the blue face
Lil Wayne tattoo face
Bad bitch with a cute face
I fuck her and her room mate
The work just came today
I break the birds down to 
Then she let me hotter than a  I love you baby
And trapping on the low low
Just me and my woe no
I don't do no porno
I just give you the total
All my niggas no joke
The plug call us loco
Snapping like a photo
Trapping in my Polo
Trapping in my Polo
Trapping in my Polo
Promethazine a no dose, recipe for oh oh
Promethazine I go pro, I go pro
Promethazine I go pro, yeah I go pro, yeah

Mula baby
Yeah
I love you, Nae Nae
