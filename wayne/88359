20 ContributorsU Gon Love Me Lyrics
I'm so sick I go to the hospital
When I don't get fixed I get nicked by the brain surgeon
If I'm losing ya, sorry I'm just brain surfing
Move in ya mind like a five in the lanes twerk it
But I'm like a six with ya bitch twerk that
I'm on the strip with ya bitch working
And I don't like strippers, I like dyke bitches
That don't like strippers; that, like bitches
Like to fight strippers, Weezy F. Baby
I don't write shit, be on the hype shit
She on that white shit
I ain't talking about cum, put powder on my dick
Then she suck it til she numb, shit
I remember back in the day
When an ounce of coke was four hundred
And them bitches was gay
But now these niggas is gay
And you could probably get an ounce for eight
Shit, if you spend eleven hundred you straight
And now the niggas with money is the niggas that hate
And bitches want a broke nigga cause them bitch niggas fake
But that's why me, and my hooligans debating, ho
Which one of these rich niggas we taking?
I gotta make it, Lil Layla's six now
My little brother J.E. wanna cop bricks now
And little Marley, he just hold his chick down
Get 'em a Benz so he can roll his chick round
I blow big in a 'Lac like a big dawg
I keep that sig in my lap like my dick dawg
Shit make me bust a nut in yo face
Tell ya girlfriend, "Bitch
Wipe the slut off yo face, ho"
Where you from? I'll put you under your state
Then I go and throw a party at Bungalow 8
Yeah I'm something so straight feared I
Knock a nigga right up in his queer eye
I ain't playing nigga this is the year I must excel
Fans sending in cards say you must get well soon
Because I'm sick, so sick sick mean
I be with a cute thing
And she do her lip thing
Well as a matter fact I think you know her well
Everytime I'm with the girl you always blowing up her cell
What, would you stop me and shorty tryna chill, man
Shorty tryna feel on my eel
I shock her like Silk
I Chaka like I'm managing a Ludacris
Handling the uzi like a camera
Choose ya flick, ya strike a pose
We pull up-in Bentley
Niggas on the bikes is hoes
I'm that cold, nigga
I'm that cold. Nigga
Though I'm a hot boy
I'm that cold niggaYou might also like2Embed
