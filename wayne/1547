28 ContributorsI Want This Forever Lyrics
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

Shit, nigga, this what I does
I swear I ain't lyin' like this is my cubs
This is my tub and I'm dirtier than the summer, bitch
Weezy F. Baby, always lookin' like I done some shit
You ain't on nothin' bitch, better know who you fuckin' with
Try to fuck me, I'll kill you and who you comin' with
No homo, T, I had to go stupid
I'm on them high heels and I am no Bootsy
Collins Avenue, ridin' with the Phantom roof gone
Or the Maybach two-tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24's boy, what are you on?
I'm richer than a bitch without the grey poupon
Yeah, I'm talkin' out of my head
I make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a blood muthafucka, a blood muthafucka
Forever like E-T-C, period muthafucka
You might also like
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

I'm so unsigned, it would blow ones mind
Cause to every single record, I am so unkind
There are no holds barred, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know drugs cost
So P-A-Y-U-P
I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me
Never L-I-E, I got everything I tell 'em I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Ya heard me?
Who else tryna smoke? Yeah, nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the preasure is what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a ski-doo
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down ho, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that: 10-4
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

Put on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit
Make a plumber throw his plunger like, "I can't deal with this shit"
They say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch I'm back on my shit like a fly
Since you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly
Like Pookie, take a dookie on the rapper loose leaf
And throw his trash ass through the window like Mookie
To a shark you just sushi
You ain't hard, you're coochie, Wally Oochie
Soft as newborn booty
Said I'm movin' slow, I'm just thinkin' fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, I'm 'bout to lap your ass
And nigga I don't rest, I'm up 'til my time's up
I been a tec chef, all my beef prime cut
This ain't punch lines, nigga your punch is lyin'
Cause the only punch you ever gave was Hawaiian
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne3Embed
