24 ContributorsKreep Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
6 shit

I said I wasn't gon' love these hoes
I ate my words like a pussy hole
She suck my dick and my bullet hole
And got on my dick, did the tootsie roll
She know how much I love candy though
She know how much I hate pantyhose
I know how much she love animals
But she let me stomp on her camel toe, damn

Girl what the deal, though
Put up them dildos, fuck with a real one
Fuck 'til the sun come, we can still chill, though
Kick it like field goals, lick it like mail, though
Sleep by your mailbox, IG yo' G spot
I kill yo' pill spot, I give a cheerleader somethin' to cheer 'bout
I get you too high, I hear yo' ears pop
You hear my key chain, you hear the birds fly
All gold dust, pull the pills out
You take your clothes off, you tell me go hard
I tell you "No duh"
And we both smoke so I rolled up
And we poured up in my gold tub
And you woke up with soap suds all up in yo' chocha
Fuck it, shawty, it's yo' fuckin' birthday
Almost fuckin' drown me, little fuckin' mermaid
Damn, fuck it, shawty, everyday yo' b-day
And if you want this D, bae, everyday is D Day, boom
I'ma lay you on your spinal cord
And you gon' take all this dinosaur
Yeah, I'ma lay you on your spinal cord
And you gon' take me on your private tour
Hol' up, I'ma lay you on your pretty face
And hit it from the back like you hit the brakes
Got a pretty face and a pretty shape
Tryna be a star and I'ma give you space
Wait, 1, girl, let's start this shit, 2, girl, yo' heart just skipped
3, girl, and you will see, 4, how good this D can be
5, I love to do you right
And 6 ain't shit if it don't end with 9
Invite yo' friend that's friendly fire
Bitches ain't shit but yours and mine
Ooh, girl I love you so
That's why I always fuck you slow
All these little hoes they come and go
She was just a flame, went up in smoke
And I told myself not to love the bitches
Hard to stop fallin' for a bitch when you trippin'
Hard to stop sleepin' on a bitch when you sippin'
When you sippin'
Can't trust these hoes, can't love these bitches
Then my heart get cold, middle finger with the mittens
Bitches lie through they teeth, I never wanted to be a dentist
Wayne’s world keep spinnin’, it ain’t love it’s business
Hoe, watch that hoe you sleep with, bitch ass hoes be creepin'
Watch that hoe she be wit', who she prolly sleep wit'
Damn, but you know that ain't cheatin, we should have a meetin'
Watch that hoe you eatin', food for thought, I'm thinkin'
You might also like
I said I wasn't gon' love these hoes
I ate my words like a pussy hole
She suck my dick and my bullet hole
Got on my dick, did the tootsie roll
She know how much I love candy though
She know how much I hate pantyhose
I know how much she love animals
But she let me stomp on her camel toe, damn

And her clit got a hair trigger
Damn, and her clit got a hair trigger
And her clit got a hair trigger
But the bitch gotta spare a nigga, damn
Watch that hoe you sleep wit', bitch ass hoes be creepin'
Watch that hoe she be wit', oh, nah, they ain't speakin'
Damn, that's that silent treatment, I don't wanna know the reason
Watch that hoe you eatin', food for thought, I'm thinkin'

That's some 6 shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
