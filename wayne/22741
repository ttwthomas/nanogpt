6 ContributorsI’m Com’n Lyrics
Boy, picture me comin', shining my motherfuckin' ass off
Nigga I'm comin' in a Ram on 19's
I don't want for nothin', livin' the million dollar dream
All of a sudden, niggas wanna do me in
Don't make me get disgusted, or over your head is 10
Me and Baby shinin', on 750 C.B.R.'s
Going to the best western with niggas in two cars
Tomorrow hoes gotta go, cause me and B flyin' back to Tennessee
Tryin to see bout some cheese
They got niggas ballin', but they don't even wanna
Get out the projects, and buy a house on Washatona
Fresh gotta Burben, pearl white with T.V.'s
My clique ain't hurtin', haul to the bank First N.B.C
Juve gotta a Beamer, blue and black with 17's
B Expedition shoppin', he just ordered 23's
It's all gravy, this life I'm livin', I'm lovin'
Young, straight thuggin', watch out for my clique cause we comin'

I'm comin', draped in diamonds, you blind homes
I'm comin', bout gettin' my fuckin shine on
I'm comin', draped in diamonds, you blind homes
I'm comin', bout gettin' my fuckin shine on
You might also like
In all black, ready to get a nigga for some yay
Playin with heavy weight, I'ma intercept your day
Don't hesitate, better play it cool, shipe
I'm up the big two, shipe, go by the rule, shipe
Drop everything where you stand nigga
Give it all up, like a man nigga
You workin' with somethin', nigga bring me to the house
Respect my mind, or get your brains knocked out
I come for the cheese, 25 G's, remain on your knees
Or I'll be forced to release, freeze
I make a nigga break down like a bucket
Nigga what, you ain't gonna what, hold up, *gun cocks* up it
Who fallin' now, loga, tell me that
Who ballin' now, broadas, flat necks
Spread it on down, with ya issue I be stunnin'
Nigga lay it down, I'm comin'

I'm comin', you better watch what you do nigga
Nigga I'm comin', you ballin' it's on you nigga
I'm comin', you better watch what you do nigga
Nigga I'm comin', you ballin', it's on you nigga

From a penny, to a nickel, to a dime, and a quarter
If a any nigga fickel-fuck with mine, then he oughta
Get his wife, son, and daughter funeral plans in order
Cause I'ma slaughter his bloodline till it's thinner than water
Went from captain Save-A-Ho, to Captain Kirk, to Captain Kangaroo
But you ain't got no army captain, so who is you a danger to
Nobody hang with you, slang with you, bang with you
Spend change with you, or do no kind of gangsta thangs with you
I'm on your heels and ain't no lettin' up
So if you hit the ground, bitch ain't no gettin' up
Niggas start the bettin' up
Put your last dime on me, your credit line on me
Ask Niggy D.D., you gon win every time on me
That ain't no lyin' on me, that's on my momma
All my niggas locked up and dead, behind all that fuckin drama
Wassup to Big Tymers, producers, groupies, bitches, and rap rhymers
Big Bun comin' like dicks and vaginas
I'm comin', just when you niggas least expected
I'm comin', so have your whole body protected
I'm comin', strong armin' your whole clique bitch
I'm comin', so wipe the cum up off my dick bitch

I got more weight then them niggas up state
My name, Raymon D., I'm the nigga with the yay
I'm from the projects, 42 dollar rent, I'm ballin'
Stackin ends, taller then tall, could never catch me fallin'
Ride slow, shine like diamonds, twinkle like gold
The young nigga, fuckin all you old niggas hoes
When I come, I come with it, I don't rep
Playa haters wanna kill me, march niggas, step
Yeah I got it, fuck them niggas, I ain't hidin' it
Hot boy with hot toys, hangin' in the closest
Ready to be fire, drama, I'm bout that
Chopper with 50 shots, nigga I pack gats
My set be on fire, hotter then the sunny
Want a package, meet me at the spot, nigga I'm comin'

I'm comin', with the coke, let me though nigga
I'm comin', playa hate me, you get removed nigga
I'm comin', with the coke, let me though nigga
I'm comin', playa hate me, you get removed nigga
Stop at the gas station and put 30 in the tank
Pockets kinda low, I hit the curb to the bank
Just thinkin' bout this bitch ass nigga, that's disrespectin'
No question, wootay bit the hand that done fed him
My nigga Doug told me, "Man ride with them choppers"
My nigga Baby told me, " man don't stop for no poppers"
Know that a bitch will get you crossed in a minute
Know that they gonna put it off till they get it
I had a bad bitch with big ass, until she was top of the line
So she stayed in Chanell fits
She ran with some made niggas, so she was a made bitch
However you wanna do it, it's all on you how she played it
She worked for Hot Boys, and I was the chairmen
Complication, just give me the Franklins
You can take it like a man or a bitch
Best to get the fuck or you wanna get flipped

I'm comin', better watch what you do nigga
I'm comin', you gotta get it, you gotta do nigga
I'm comin', Juvenile is comin' through nigga
I'm comin', I'ma knock your brains in your shoes nigga
I'm comin', better watch what you do nigga
I'm comin', Juvenile is comin' through nigga
I'm comin', I'ma knock your brains in your shoes nigga
I'm comin', better watch what you do nigga1Embed
