36 ContributorsMillyrokk Lyrics
No ceilings
No ceilings
No ceilings
My ceiling drop, my ceiling drop

Ayy, my milly rock, my milly pop (Bop!)
Them niggas ain't hot, they petty wap
Sippin' Barney, smokin' Baby Bop
She's performing on the table top
Steph Curry, boy, I'll take the shot (Bop-bop)
Then I'll pull off and wave goodbye
I'm ready for the war, I'm not afraid to die
My niggas wild like Omega Psi
My bitches screamin' "Ooh-la-la"
I tell my demons "Kumbaya"
Them sticks go "Boo-ya-ka"
Make a nigga say "Uhh na-na-na-na-na"
I got money on my mental
Got them niggas in my rear view
I'm a dog, I'm a dog
Rottweilin' on these Shih tzu's
Drop dollars on your temple
Pop collars like a pistol
Drive back and forth for codeine
Put some mileage on the rental
Money talks like Jimmy Kimmel
Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno
I'm straight N.O., the U-N-O
Fast life, so uptempo
Ooh-wee, Presidential
In the Backwood, eating Mentos
Smoke that loud like crescendos
Rep the Mob like De Niro
Fucking like a nympho
Save her info like a hero
Write your name on a bullet
She wrote my name on her dildo
Smoking on that kill though
Got me happier than Gilmo'
I'm in chill mode, I'm in pill mode
I just fucked your fucking ear hole
You might also like
No ceilings, woah
No ceilings
Yeah, two
Yeah, two
Holler at them bitches, Lucci Lou

Give a fuck about you haters
More concerned with stacking paper
Smoking bog and sipping Lakers
Watch your girl 'cause I can take her
Drop the top, no ceilings
As I'm plottin' on millions
With my niggas in this bitch
They like "Fuck it Lucci, get 'em"
I'm from that East side of New Orleans
Polo T's and Jordans
Where niggas dream to push foreigns
And all the hoes want ballers
I got the cheapest price on pearly white
If you need it, nigga, just call us
Long as you talking them dollars
I got it, nigga, just holler
Still no job – bitch, I ain't hurtin'
Put a ho on the stroll and told her "Get to workin'"
She dropped a Xanny in his drink, the Rolly in her purse
Then brought it back to Daddy, man I swear this pimpin' work
I pop the clutch and hit the gas, I love the way it skrrt
She popped a bean and poppin' ass, can't keep it in her skirt
I beat it up, she eat it up, no feelings
It's Lucci Lou and Tunechi, nigga, no ceilings
No ceilings, bih, like an astronaut
Turk and Wayne back at it, nigga, we ain't gon' stop
Thuggin' nigga, it's thug life, 2Pac
My youngin with me, they stay strapped with two Glocks
I'm Molly turnt, but so uptown, throwing threes up like slime
Pussy nigga keep hating on me, keep hating, I ain't got time
Too busy chasing this paper, got money on my mind
Fuck you and your favors, know you seen my grind
I kicked the habit, never thought I could
That shit had me since fourteen
I was shooting up, nigga, on tour, fucking up my dreams
Fucking off my green, fucking off with these hoes
Could've died over a million times, I swear only God knows
Now I'm back nigga, like a hungry dog at the doorstep, let's eat
Tell you pussy niggas that slept on me
"Hope you bitches die in your sleep"
Free my brother BG
I'ma scream the shit til he hit the streets
Til my brother Ralo RIP, I got that nigga
That's YNT

No ceilings, yeah, nigga, nigga
No ceilings, yeah, fuck with me it be a killin'
Yeah, Young Turk, nigga
I'm Mister YNT, nigga13Embed
