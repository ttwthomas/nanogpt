Uh
Aw yeah, aw yeah
Call up on drank and let's
Let's call up and, uh

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah
You know what I'm
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Uh, oh yes, oh yeah
Yeah, uh

You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

Yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank and let's all get faded, yeah
Aw yeah, aw yeah
