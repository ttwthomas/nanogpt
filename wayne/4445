22 ContributorsMoney In My Pocket (Remix) Lyrics
Tunechi in this bitch
Fresh, watch me do it
Bitches know I ball
I go HAM, Cam Newton
Shorty on the pill
Get this ho some fluids
And if that bitch bad I put her on my

See, see I’m stepping out froze
Louis on my toes
All this money in my pocket got these hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got these hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Now my stacks don’t fold
I got too much to hold
All this money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole
Money in my pocket got them hoes on the pole

Now holla for a dollar
Act strange for the change
That's my nigga Gudda Gudda
Yeah he came in the Range
My homie, Mack Maine with the Range and the chains
And me I’m so fly, I swear I came in a plane then landed on a lot
Smooth like grease, laughing at the pop you should choose like teeth
Fresh outfit boy, came to shut it down
And it’s only gon be worn once like a wedding gown
Somebody tell the town Short Dawgs in the annex
Pistol on my hip and I pop it like a Xanex
Got the niggas tripping cause we got the hoes dripping
You see I’m balling like Jordan you just a Scottie Pippen
Catch you slipping
Then you better go and get ya boys
I get em work
My money longer than extension cords
Tell them runts I got some game I can sell em
I walk up on her
While she with them lames and I tell her
You might also like

It’s young Elvis Freshly in the four door European
And the tint dark as coffee, a nigga feeling bossy
Pulling hoes like a tooth and it’s hard to get em off me
I’m a stunna like the CEO of Cash Money records
The Louie V rag got me chequered with the matching kicks
Grinnin’ at your chick, the surp got me leaning like ten after six
Therefore I tell her, go on bust it open, go on bust it open
They call me Short Dawg but no I ain't from Oakland
My money so tall that you gon have to climb it
If she know how to rewind it, trust me I’m gon change the climate
And then I get behind it like I’m tryna do the heimlich
She heard that I be rhyming and I’m balling like Kirk Hinrich
She’s looking for some love, but over here she will not find it
So get down on your knees, you’re int he presence of Your Highness


Tunechi in this bitch fresh watch me do it
Bitches know I ball I go HAM, Cam Newton
Shorty on the pill, get this ho some fluids
And if that bitch bad
I put her on my to-do list
See I step up in this bitch like a gamma, get your cameras
Money on the table bitch, respect my table manners
Young Money the shit, did you get the memorandom
And these other niggas think they flying the Atlantic
Haa, What you doing
I’m throwing money, they take too long with the ones
Fuck It, I’ll start throwing hundreds
Y'all niggas ain't spending shit
They tippin’ on a budget
Man, they pockets getting skinny, what that is Jennifer Hudson
Order a bottle and I drink it 'til it's hollow
And my coupe is a two-seater so you bitches gotta follow
Now bust it open backwards like the doors on a Rolls
I got money in my pocket, I got hoes on pause
