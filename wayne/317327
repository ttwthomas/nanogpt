Say what the fuck going on, man it must be twerk season
Something in the air, it must be twerk season
Cause they dancing, dancing for no reason
Man they dancing, dancing, dancing for no reason

Bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk
Twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk
Twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk

Big up to my amigo, he gave me a kilo for my ego
Talking 'bout you popped the molly? You just took you a placebo
And my suit is Valentino, she is hot as jalapeno
I can do a drive-by listening to Bobby Valentino
I can make her ass wiggle, I can get some cash with her
Talking 'bout your ex-boyfriend, fuck you and your last nigga
You ain't talking 'bout shit if you ain't talking 'bout us
Saying something in the air, y'all bitches some ones
Twerk, twerk, twerk
Have you ever got some head while driving in reverse?
I ain't into backing up, but just in case I'm backing out
Now look how she reacting, now I put it in, she asking ow

Big up to my lil sweet ho, my lil petite ho, keep it a C-note
When my main ho act like a P.O, ain't that frio, that's Sub-Zero
I say one time for that bitch, who just want dick and some to eat
Only want a number three, that's my pussy custody
I want a slim fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got no nosy friends, just a purse with her
She ain't got a lot of ass but I can work with her
Nigga, that's my cup of tea, ahh, burnt my tongue
Ooh, she got a popcorn booty
Everytime I see that ass it make me wanna watch a movie
It's supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerking going on?
