9 ContributorsHoes & Ladies Lyrics
Hey, yee
Just in, Young Fyre
Teddy P

And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up
And she don’t wanna mess up her hair
And if you wanna fuck, like I wanna fuck
Put your muthafucking hands in the air
I’m on Five-Hour Energy, Nuvo and Hennessy
So what you wanna do little baby
Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady

I’m so considerate, I never quit a bitch
No matter how many niggas hit, or how many dick she licked
I please that clitoris, I give her a kiss and shit
When other niggas don’t stay long enough, they get the digits and split
If ain't nobody telling you that you are pretty
That's just because you are and they do not want to admit it
Look at all that ass, you ain't got to have titties
At least you part of the itty bitty titty committee really
You goin let em style on you, or you can let em talk
Hop up in this Lamborghini, baby, go on let em walk
Stop hanging round them stupid bitches, you’d be better off
Them hoes dirty birds, Atlanta Hawks
Go on wear them granny draws
Matter of fact go put that dress on, and don't wear any drawls and come sit on Santa Claus
We can take some pictures with the islands in the back drop
We can go to PC, but you’ll still be my laptop
See T-Pain LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up
And she don’t wanna mess up her hair
And if you wanna fuck, like I wanna fuck
Put your muthafucking hands in the air
I’m on Five-Hour Energy, Nuvo and Hennessy
So what you wanna do little baby
Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady

Kiss her on the thigh make her pussy hole cry
They say numbers don't lie, lets try a 69
Kiss her on her lips let her pussy hole drip
She can't even walk to the bathroom she gotta skip
Kiss her on her cheek, make her pussy lips speak
Now she pulling on my locks, Kiss, Styles, Sheek
Kiss her on her breasts, east and west
And then I go south and clean up my mess
No stop signs, no red lights
She put on a show, no stage fright
And then I fuck her right, and she say fucking right
She climb on top that mountain and ride that mountain bike
She keep it nice and wet, like Armor All,
She keep a close shave like Barbasol
But all in all she’s just Weezy baby
And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up
And she don’t wanna mess up her hair
And if you wanna fuck, like I wanna fuck
Put your muthafucking hands in the air
I’m on Five-Hour Energy, Nuvo and Hennessy
So what you wanna do little baby
Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady3Embed
