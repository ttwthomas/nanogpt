35 ContributorsLose It Lyrics
What’s Gucci my nigga? What’s Louis my killa?

(I feel like I can’t follow in nobody footstep) Getting GuWop
You know I pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, at your head my nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, pop pills, make mills young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga, young nigga

I think I'm bout to lose it, mayne
Said I'm 'bout to go Gucci Mane
In the trap still countin' change
Don’t fuck with y'all cause you niggas lame
Said I’m ‘bout to go Gucci Mane
Said I’m ‘bout to go Gucci Mane
On the choppa rant, on the choppa rant
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop

Still-a in that trap getting GuWop
Out the sewer, now my crib the size of Cuba
I be riding around with that blocka
We them Brick Squad, ask Flocka
Versace shit, Silk The Shocker
Coulda been San Quentin on lock
But I two'd up that ghost, I stack two floors that loaf
I be floor seats by that coach, I be fight seats by that rope
Lately so sick I could vomit, Gin with no tonic
Cheat on my bitch, you know I'm dishonest
But I’m just a product of my environment
Young nigga, young nigga, pop pills, make mills young nigga
Got wrist, stay trill young nigga, still toting that steel young nigga
And I ain't ever lose a chain
And shawty head stupid man
See French Montana LiveGet tickets as low as $195You might also like
I think I’m 'bout to lose it, mayne
Said I’m 'bout to go Gucci Mane
In the trap still countin’ change
Don’t fuck with y’all ‘cause you niggas lame
Said I’m 'bout to go Gucci Mane
Said I’m 'bout to go Gucci Mane
On the choppa rant, on the choppa rant
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop

Uh, get down or lay down
Shoot everything up but a school or a playground
Run shit like a Greyhound
I’m in here, now who let the Devil in?
I ain’t been taking my medicine
My trigger finger ain’t never been hesitant
I am your ruler, no measurements
You know I pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, at your head my nigga
Cash Money 'til I die, even if I go broke, I still wouldn't beg to differ
I'm off papers, I heart paper, no short paper, better get the point
Cause I'm point-shaven with a sharp razor, get buck like a horse stable
Too street smart, I’m a geek, I put my niggas on they feet
So if we fall, it be that lean that make a nigga fall asleep
I can’t see none of you niggas, and I can see the future man
Where you going? I’m bout to go Tunechi man
I think I’m 'bout to lose it, mayne
Said I’m 'bout to go Gucci Mane
In the trap still countin' change
Don’t fuck with y'all cause you niggas lame
Said I’m 'bout to go Gucci Mane
Said I’m 'bout to go Gucci Mane
On the choppa rant, on the choppa rant
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop

Getting GuWop
You know I pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, at your head my nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, pop pills, make mills young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga, young nigga30Embed
