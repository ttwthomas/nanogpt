Here we go again
Ten years later
You know what man? Uhm
("I wanna know!")
Fuck it
Ayo C
Give me that Jameson and that pickle juice
Thank you
I got some shit on my mind
("I wanna know!")

My little nigga Frogg dead, dog
They shot my little nigga in his head, dog
You heard what the fuck I just said, dog?
Walk inside my closet like fuck everything red, dog
If you seen your best friend stiff, you would cry too
Sometimes I don't even wanna be a Piru
Then I think about it like, fuck everything blue
Who killed my motherfuckin' brother?
("I wanna know!")
Who killed G man too? The shit I seen men do
If I told you, I'd have me floating in some cement shoes
See Compton ain't shit really
And I’ve been at the bottom of the pits, feel me?
I done had some real niggas try to kill me
Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot, had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac, I’m like birdie at the troops
I can’t lie, every time I see Suge my heart beat
Cause I don’t know if I should dap him or let the hawk speak
Wilmington and Brazil, nigga them my cross streets
And who gon’ take it from me?
See The Game LiveGet tickets as low as $163You might also like
They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ain’t nothing gon' change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I’m gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

I was playing Madden then I heard a knock
Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest, it's kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one: the homies never came to see me
Suspect two: Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three: I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldn't see me
There's usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night, I'm like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
I'm cool with taking mine, but I took other niggas' gunshots
Chest wide open, I'm tryna fight, but my lungs not
Hole in my chest bout the size of a kumquat
I know who shot me 'cause I shot them
But who set me up? I ain't tripping but—
("I wanna know!")
They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ain’t nothing gonna change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I’m gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

Let me tell you how I met my nigga Wack
Shit, he ain't always have a nigga back
When I met him, he was standing behind Suge
And everything is all good when you banging for your hood
Compton
That nigga Wack got my number and came through
Now let me tell you the type of shit the Game do
He walked in the booth where I was spitting
Gave him ten thousand, couldn't even finish his fuckin' sentence
I ain't owe him shit, but real recognize real
Now we like two red-nosed Pits
Cross him, you gotta cross me
And don't forget about where my nigga AR be
He be in the cut, that niggas nuts, don't give a fuck
Love his nigga Game to death, and he mean it from the guts
Blood, what's up? Which one of you dumb mothafuckas wanna try us?
