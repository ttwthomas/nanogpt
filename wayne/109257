Remix baby!

Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussies, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't usin' hands
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussies, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't usin' hands

Montana!
Bands a make her dance, 20's make her glance
50's make her flip, 100's make her give me head (head)
Cheeks clappin', she don't use no hands
All this pussy poppin', I'm just poppin' bands
I just pay the mortgage, I just pay the note
Hurricane Katrina, bitch you need a boat
Bitch you need to float, show me what you twerk with
20 bottles, 30 models, 40 burners bitch!

She like, "What the fuck is a dollar bill?"
Ass bounce like Impala wheels
3 wheel motion, grippin' grain
Fuck emotions, just get the change
I don't know what you thinkin' mang
I take your money and get the brain
Them other bitches ain't built the same
He say, "You can't be real who built your frame?"
Ever seen a stripper go right, left?
Make it really wanna go pipe that
But you ain't really gonna Ike that
She fuck your brain, no mic check
Money, money, bet you brake it off
You see that ass, you see that cash, bet she take it off like...
You might also like
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussies, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't usin' hands
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussies, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't usin' hands

I brought some bandz so won't you dance?
Do a stack, you on 2 hands
Another stack now that's 2 bandz
Brought a friend now that's 2 fans
Gettin' trippy now that's 2 Xans
Double that now that's 4 bandz
Juicy J, he got more bandz
Trappin' hard like Snowman
Smokin' loud, I know the grow man
Been gettin' money since a young nigga
But they respect me now cause I'm a grown man, ooh
Condo by the ocean, forgot my watch now that's a Rolex
Hit the strip club and spend more bread
And spill champagne on her forehead
Smokin' and sippin
I'm talkin' that rich shit hopin' that broke niggas listen
Shorty keep poppin' it, strippin'
I got to reach into my pockets to keep tippin'
Seen her with the teams, that's my bandz chick
Got rich off the internet so it's safe to say that's my bandwidth
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussies, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't usin' hands
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussies, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't usin' hands

Bandz a make her dance
It'll get her wet, it'll make that ass go h.a.m
It'll get her heels high for the sky
It'll make them 2 lips kiss the floor when she land, damn
That outta do it, if I'm with a bitch then she probably hood
Gin on the rocks, gon' off the kush
She gon' off them beans, she in Mollywood
And she dance for my bandz like it's homecoming
If she ain't working gettin' money, she at home cumming
I state the facts, I brake her back if I drop a grip like it's snow money
I see broke niggas watching, cause they ain't got no paint
It's a lot of niggas saving hoes but Bobby Ray can't
I say what's going broke, can y'all reminds us?
Lost in the money can't y'all finds us?
Tasha and Nicole sliddin' on a pole
Booty going dumb like Alzheimer
I say what's going broke please y'all remind us?
Self made niggas no co-signers
Tasha and Nicole sliddin' down a pole
Booty going dumb like Alzheimer
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussies, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't usin' hands
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussies, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't usin' hands

Bank tellers, bad bitches, paid niggas, they love me
Stripper hoes, married women, I be wherever the bub be
Met a dancer chick named Porsche, with a stallion ass like a horse
In V.I.P, at KOD's, I'm gettin' oral intercourse
Twerking for bandz, I be on Xan
She gon' keep popping them racks on your hand
Juicy stay making it rain in the club
And I ain't leaving until that bitch flood
Rolling like it's nothing and I don't give a damn
I would say no to ratchet pussy but I just don't think I can
In the suite with a stripper sippin' lean and tweakin'
Pop molly in that ass, watch her get freaky
Gotta get some brain man, see what she thinkin'
Shawty don't spit, she like to keep it
White girl on that Oxy, I'm on Bombay and that KK
Got major bread like Mitt Romney
Fuck making it rain a tsunami

Bandz a make her dance1Embed
