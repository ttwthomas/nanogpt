2 ContributorsI’m A Rocker LyricsChrome on the monster
Leather intestines
Wit a top model and the contestants
I'm a Rottweiler
Yes im a rock n rolla
Its weezy fukin baby
Yea straight up out the stroller
Im higher than the solar
System marly twist em
Im like macully culcan
I was rich wen I was pissin
On my self im ballin
You niggas hate-a-holics
Im just a recipe
So you can save the garlic
Im like a set of keys
Im bout to get it started
I smoke that beverly
Hills from califorina
Dem bitches after me
So I put that paddle on em
She rode my dick and said she shudda put a saddle on em
I watch out for dem snakes
Listen for that rattle homie an I ain't gotta click

Baby boy rising like hot warter and caine

Now she can't leave so we fuck in the club
Am I lucky or what playboy rabbit
And I like big tounges like skate board fashion
I got more girls than the playboy mansion
I bet I serve em up like my name pete sanfris
And a nigga drink like the late fred sanford
And a nigga smoke like there is no cancer
And I kno this world is so cold and decivin
But I keep my head up like my nose is bleedin
And until that chosen evenin
Ima be screamin apple an eagle
Yea dats right apple and eagle
Hollygrove 17th I won't leave you
Nope and this is just the previw
But I am already working on the sequel
(bridge)
Fuck wit me wrong I fuck wit ya home
Like a letter to the wife say ya husband is gone
Like muslim im calm but like muslim I bomb
And beat the track up like a hundread arms
Im funky like underarms
The engine recording a thunderstorm
My hunger forms then rings the alarm
The carter 2 was nice but the 3rd times the charm weezyEmbed
