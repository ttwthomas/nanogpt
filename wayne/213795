I DON,T NEED TO SEE VERSACE OR
THE HEAD OF MEDUSA/
LEAVE MY PAST WITH THE PAST
CAUSE MY FUTURE IS MUSIC
AND YOU TRY TO HOLD ME BACK
LIKE A FIGHTIN STUDENT
TWO WRONGS DON,T MAKE A RIGHT
SO WHY DEAL WITH THE BULLSHIT
JUST STAY IN THE RIGHT CIRCLE CAUSE THE SQAURES AIN,T PERFECT
SO I GO HARD OF THESES BITCHE
KEEP HER PUSSY WETTER THIN FISHS
AND I ONLY WRITE AT NIGHT BECAUSE NIGGAS BE STEALIN VISION
