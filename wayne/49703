13 ContributorsYMCMB Heroes Lyrics
Ah, ah, life, life, I’m livin' my life, life
Got a bitch with an ass so nice
Night time takin' off your tights
Have a G night, night
Gettin' head on a flight, flight
Twenty hour flight
I ain’t never been a hater motherfucker I ain’t got no time
Young money like the Lakers in their prime
Make money off a motherfuckin' rhyme
T-Raw in the bitch like
With a bad bitch tryin' to get a ring in a prom
My swaggers is nice, word is bond she might not know my name
But she know my song
‘Really Raw’ Tyga dog, tiger blood
I eat your heart out
Lick my paws, Hannibal Lecter I’m so involved
Follow along, Jay Sean pass the Patron
We shinin' hard up in this motherfucker

So hit the lights, lights, lights
So hit the lights, hit the lights
Tell them all, tell them tell them hard, light it up, go to the sky
So hit the lights, lights, lights
So hit the lights, hit the lights
Tell them all, tell them tell them hard, light it up, go to the sky
You might also like
Baby hold it and let me holla on the remix for a moment
So watch me kick it then I’m gonna flip this script and own it
To all the haters, I made it and I be balling
Yeah I’m the motherfuckin' man and I’ma brag
And I'm glad that your listenin' to every word
So you can sit and analyze and think of every curse
So you can try and describe what you think of this verse
So go ahead take your time and rewind it back
It won't change, I got, got, so many niggas that
So many million sales they be up on plaques
On the walls in my crib as of matter a fact
Yes it’s me, come all the way from overseas
Took that spot from the Black Eyed Peas
Number one Billboard entry
Don’t get me started this ain’t no petty party
I’m hardly new to the game, I served my time in the army
Quarter of a billion views up on YouTube
U.K’s number one most viewed
Come out of the dark
I don’t mean to be rude
But it’s true somebody


It's Bussa Rhymes baby
Back in the kitchen I’m cookin' and I think you better listen
Look I hit them again
While I give it to them, a kick in the door
And I shook them again let me spit it to them, oh shit
Comin' and goin' and I be runnin' the show and I be knowin' they knowin'
And I be gunnin' and blowin'
And I be stitchin' and sewin' up everythin' up in this bitch, let’s go
Everybody know that I’ma come
And I’ma kill ‘em when we step up in the building
And you know that I’ma hit them
And I do it how I do it now I gotta get them, explosive
Every time I grab a microphone you know I must rep
Everybody know it ain’t a Henny kill a dupstep
And I murder everything while becoming a suspect
Better hit the lights
Better know that I’ma come and I’ma run them off
You know it ain’t a secret bitch you fuckin' with a boss
Bring me any bottle it don’t matter what it cost
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah we got them wildin' in the buildin' right now
The king is up in here you better bring the right crown
Cause you might be in the space, you better turn the light down
It's the conglomerate, YMCMB
Do you really think you really wanna test me
When you niggas know already who the best be
So I hang them then I cut them, I bang them then I shut them
Then I hit it up you know its only right
Then I’m gonna hit them in the front
I hit them in the back then I really think that people really need to see so

Yeah Cash Money till the end of me
We family, he’s a friend of me
Make real nigga moves, you pretendin' to be
Get it like LeBron give it, can you get to me
Little nigga wanna be me for the pay
Baby girl dug how nigga feel the day
Thuggin' in public while my broads say they love it
Couple of years back had pictures on my budget
My main chick  my stomach
See chief posse, YMCMB, thug runners
Stunna man say it other niggas get done in
My team get to it, other niggas run from it
Tune got me touring the world that one hundred
Niggas did it all, still I ain’t done nothing
Jay Sean got us in the U.K gone
Gone nigga gone hit the stage strong
Watch what you say, long as the pay long
Niggas think I'm a joke get hit with the tray long
Word to Wayne I bet they herd the name
So he reserved the lane for me to start to flame
Takin' the boat, we don’t take the plane
Ho girl shake it, you deserve the change
All she really want is a few furs of fame
Pop champagne, Wear the chain
Nah me and T ain’t letting them wear the chain
Unless she likes all that with her brain
Bruce Lee flow on the track, clear the frame
Hood be the niggas since Wayne and MackMaine
Tez Slim, the don and stunna man
YMCM that will never change
Tell them other niggas behave and act sane
But beginning right here is the action
