You don't want zero problems, big fella!
Yep! Igh!

If one more label try to stop me
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby, huh huh

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

Ooh, watch me come and put the hinges in their hands
Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand, huh
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings out my lap
Bitch I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap, hey
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
Fuck you thought it was?
You talk that talk that make a lame-ass nigga fall in love
Not me, though, bitch, you can keep those
Bruh, I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo
Don't tweak, bro, it's never sweet, ho
My shooters come for free, so
See Chance the Rapper LiveGet tickets as low as $47You might also like

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha
(Yeah, 2 Chainz)
They be like, "There he go!"

You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mamas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money (Money)
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea (True)
Big yacht, no power steering (Yeah)
Aye, aye, captain (Ooh!)
I'm high, captain (A-alright!)
I'm so high (I'm so high)
Me and God dappin' (Alright)
This is my blessin' (Yeah)
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha
Yep
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
They be like, "There he go!"
I got problems bigger than these boys, yeah
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
They say so, ridin' with the payo'
They be like, "There he go!"
There he go
