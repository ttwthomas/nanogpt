1 ContributorLoved LyricsDo You Want To Teeeeaaarrrr mmmeeeehhhh
KING SHIT KING SHIT
(Chorus)
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
Cuz I've been loved and when the day come that I get judged
Believe me baby I won't budge baby I won't budge
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
And Then We Live And Then We Die
Sometimes we fall and then we fly Lord let me fly
God Knows I wasn't ready for this one
God Knows I wasn't Ready To miss ya
From The Cracks Of Concrete comes the rodes we started out
On the Concrete where crack and we rose far
We let things coming up I suppose
What drove us to dream and pack things in our clothes
Tell that pops was a fiend and I know
Told Mama I don't want to be that please don't let me be that
She cried and said baby be strong they wrong mama cuz you raised a man on yo own
I love that pops came around though he said he had to let the streets raise me I ain't mad look how the streets raise me
All the game that the streets gave me
It's up to me we gon eat baby
I miss mike and the way it used to be maybe
That's the reason that I beast on these beats lately
I know you still with me
You might also likeI've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
Cuz I've been loved and when the day come that I get judged
Believe me baby I won't budge baby I won't budge
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
And Then We Live And Then We Die
Sometimes we fall and then we fly Lord let me fly
I woke up on the wrong side of the sofa
Eatin most of rollacoastas rollin ova
Son of an act mom was a soldier slightly embarrassed about how i growed up see pop wasn't around when he was around he was slanging pounds and him and mom fight in the middle of the night
I saw one strike a woman that I love her woman that I like
Never In My life expressed even a wife
So right here at this moment right here
Right hand on my heart swears coming from my heart
Steering through the trenches I ain't even trying to stop
I'm trying take it straight to the top
I'm trying to places where it's hot in the winter
Remember Cereal for breakfast cereal for dinner
And what makes it special that I ain't even tripping you raised you a man with quickness against all odds
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
Cuz I've been loved and when the day come that I get judged
Believe me baby I won't budge baby I won't budge
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
And Then We Live And Then We Die
Sometimes we fall and then we fly Lord let me fly
(lil Wayne):
Yeah and every time I see the sun shine
I drop down a give thanks at least one time
Feeling like I'm living on the front line
I'm Feeling like every second is crush time
I've had breakfast will I make to lunch time
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for a punchline
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime I don't know the answer that why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night pistol on my lap at every single red light
Yeah I made my bed rights so when I do I should sleep tight and peace I RIP
Before I sleep I pray to the lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake I pray to the lord my souls I've taken for goodness sake
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
Cuz I've been loved and when the day come that I get judged
Believe me baby I won't budge baby I won't budge
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
And Then We Live And Then We Die
Sometimes we fall and then we fly Lord let me flyEmbed
