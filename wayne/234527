5 ContributorsWeezy on Retirement Lyrics
Would I ever think about retiring? Uh... I look at retirement, like y— I look at retiring, like, you retire out when you die out, straight up, 'cause you never retire out what you do. You never retire out of what you do, mean—meaning: if you put so much into— if what you do is your life, like mine—you know what I mean? Like, my career is my life. So I could never retire out. Even when I stop rapping, I'm gon' still be, some kind of way or form or fashion, "in it"—you know what I mean? Like, when I die, there's going to be rappers at my funeral—hopefully—you know what I mean? But—you know what I mean? That—That's just how it is. Or, y'all gonna remember that "that nigga was a rapper." But hopefully, I go down for something—known for something different—not "different," but known for something else, also, you know what I mean? But that's what I'm gon' do. It ain't "hopefully." I know what I'm going to do. I'm that nigga, man.You might also likeEmbed
