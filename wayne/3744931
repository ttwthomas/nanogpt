She, she, she licked me like a lollipop, ooh

Shawty want a thug

You know I like to touch ya lovely lady lumps

Okay, lil mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair down her back like mine
I make her feel right when it's wrong like lyin'
Man, she ain't never had a love like mine
But man, I ain't never seen an ass like hers
That pussy in my mouth had me lost for words
So I told her back it up like, "burp, burp"
And made that ass jump like, "jerp, jerp"
And that's when she
