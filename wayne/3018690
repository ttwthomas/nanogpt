Yeah
Life of the party, anything goes
Life of the party, anything goes
Crib full of liquor and some pretty ass hoes
We the life of the party, aye
Hahaha I like that

Life of the party, anything goes
Crib full of liquor and some pretty ass hoes
The life of the party, aye
(Life of the party) Bitch

Hold on
Table full of liquor
Section full of bitches and it's all for ya nigga
Who the life of the party? (Life of the party)
Life of the party (Life of the party)
Table full of hoes
Celebrating life baby anything goes
Life of the party (Life of the party)
Aye, Life of the party (Life of the party)

Somebody call the waitress, tell her bring another round
Celebrating life, baby girl it's going down
Life of the party, table full of hotties
 on belly shots, lick it off her body
Raw paper burnin'
Rollin' up the Cali
Baby girl turn up, rollin' of the molly
Clenchin' on her lips, pretty bitches from the Valley
Sniffin' on that Sally (Life of the party)
Aye, I got some freaks in the living room getting it on
I can't be your baby daddy leave them kids on your dome
It's like 6 in the morn'
Give her dick and Patron
She get to suckin' on that jimmy, slurp that shit off the 
I touch down in the pussy, do my dance in the zone
Light the weed in the bong
Smoke like sativa cologne
Gotta go to sleep with the chrome
Wakin' up in the pussy like Baby Boy and Taraji
Fuck her like Lucious and Cookie
Got the juiciest 
Don't wear no Juicy Couture
Knock down the walls like construction
Bitch I'm abusing the core
I spit the kids on the floor
What are the gonna do with the bore (Yeah)
Fuck 'em then pass 'em around 'cause I'm through with the whore
You might also like
Here go Wayne, uh, uh (Yeah)
Chris, I got this (Get 'em)
Bitch, it goes Wayne's World
Party time
Drugs and girls
Sorry mom
Middle finger to Father Time
New Orleans nigga turn up like Mardi Gras
Put your pride aside
Put your draws aside
And I'ma turn up in that pussy like a water slide
She gone' turn up on this dick after she snort a line
And now I got this bitch screaming "Free Carter 5!"
I got some freaks in the living room gettin' it on
And they all got baby daddies, babies sittin' at home
They left they rings, and they panties, and they feelings at home
I'm on that lean and them Xannies and I'm feeling so calm
I'm on that lean and them Xannies and I'm finna doze off
She on that Molly and the Addies and she float like a drone
The house party is my addy and my shoes off at the door
Bunch of bitches be embarrassed like they got extra toes
Leave yo phone with security, don't wear extra clothes
They got coke on they nose, lookin' like eskimos
We get loud, we get wicked everywhere that we go
We get down, we just kick it Jozy Altidore
We the wild, we the sickest, ain't got no antidote
We gone' growl at them niggas, party animals
Party animals, We gone leave with some hoes
We don't leave 'til it's closed
We gone chill 'til we froze, hey
We just chillin', spillin' liquor with the bitches
Pitchers and it's all for ya nigga
Who the life of the party? (Life of the party)
Life of the party (Life of the party)
C'mon, Got it poppin' with the bitches, got it goin'
Spillin' liquor, have a shot of DeLeón
Life of the party (Life of the party)
Life of the party (Life of the party)
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Life of the party
Yeah, Life of the party

Who we is, bitch?
We are- the life of the party
Bitch, we the life of the party, yeah
Moolah baby!
