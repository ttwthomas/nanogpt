2 ContributorsGrapes On A Vine Lyrics
Ooooh (Oh, oh, oh)
Mmmmm (oh, oh)
Oh (Oh, oh)
Ohhhh-whoa
(Oh...oh-oh...)

Daddy always told me to be real
Daddy always said that, I should say just what I feel
People, they will judge you cause they just don't understand
You're in it for the long ride, you don't just give up on a man
And like every woman who's been through the fire as well
We ALL got a story half afraid to tell, yeah
People they will judge you 'cause they just can't comprehend
You're headed for the long ride, you don't just give up on a friend

(Now the ones have moved on) Gone to where the sun shines all the time
(We're still standing) Though some might think we've lost our minds
(We shall fulfill) our legacy divine
It's just that we're so different, makes our place a little harder to find

Grapes on a vine (Grapes on a vine) don't always make sweet wine
Grapes on a vine, yeah, don't always make sweet wine
Grapes on a vine (Grapes on a vine) don't always make sweet wine
Might be bitter, but it gets better with time
You might also like
Momma always said that, it's okay to dream
Momma always warned me things ain't always what they seem (and my momma told me...)
People, they will judge you; leave you sittin' on a shelf
Remember it's a long ride, just don't you give up on yourself
And like every man, who wants to make his mark
We ALL got a secret hidden in our hearts, yeah {We all got a secret}
People they will judge us, 'cause they just don't really see
We're in it for the long ride, just don't you give up on you and me, no!


Uh, uh
Grapes on a vine, ain't nuttin' sweet
You gotta pay the price, just keep your receipt
I can make the world have a seat on my feet
And I come from New Orleans where the water too deep
Money bring problems, the funny thang 'bout it
Everybody want it, want it 'til they got it
Sometimes I forget and put my trouble in my pockets
Then hang up my pants, now I got monsters in my closet
Get right with me, Miss Wright with me
Die hard, I got too much life in me
Shades on, I'm seein past that
Bittersweet wine, where your glass at?
Toast! You haters are ghost
I make y'all sick, you need a full dose, ha!
And my momma told me do me
And stay away from that fruit tree, because..

{Do you, do you}
So do you, do you, do yooooooooooou...
(Miss Wright with me) Be your own best friend
(Miss Wright with me) Be your own best friend
(Miss Wright with me, Miss Wright with me) Be your own best friend
(Miss Wright, Miss Wright, Miss Wright with me)
You gotta love on you before anybody else can learn to
You gotta love you, LOVE you, yeaaaaah, love you, love youEmbed
