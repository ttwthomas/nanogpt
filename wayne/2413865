35 ContributorsBack On the Bullshit Lyrics
Cardo got wings
Yung Exclusive
Umm
They say we smoke, we gon' smoke
You say we gon' drink ,we gon' drink
You say you want drugs, we want drugs
We don't give a fuck what you think

Big dually parked in my driveway
Hanging out that motherfucker sideways
Residue in my fingernail, make every day like Friday
This how we do it on the southside
Bumpin' Trapaveli on the car ride
Bad booty shots got you lopsided
I buy a new car if my car die
Solid gold Jesus, two of 'em
Backseat I'ma call it futon
Ride around in motherfucker uwop
Like who-a-who-a-who-a-who-a
Bought a bad bitch, I got a crew of 'em
It's four fur coats, I got a zoo of 'em
It's thug life, niggas I don't fool with 'em
I don't care if I went to school with 'em
Come out that thing like yeet
Everybody with me, nigga D
Everybody with me, nigga D
Everybody with me nigga eat
Black ink all on my body
I pray a body don't get on my shotty
I pray nobody don't get in my way nigga
A to the motherfucking K nigga
Start spittin' lyrical bullets
Don't be surprised if I pull it
Don't be surprised if I shoot it
We the type to pick on a bully
We the type to ride in foreigns
We the type to ride on Forgis
Pinky ring look like a smoothie
Flame goin' up on a Tuesday
You might also like
You on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
Now, you on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
Now, you on that bullshit ain't you?

Big thing parked in the driveway
Squad hotter than Zimbabwe
IPhone got a nigga irate
Ringing all day, all day, like Kanye
Got AK bullets with your name on 'em
Powder on my hands, King James on 'em
I walk around this bitch with my chest out
Yeah nigga bout to go Ving Rhames on 'em
Man look at who I done became on 'em
Niggas look who and I went switch lanes on 'em
All my niggas brainless, need brain donors
We movin' birds, gettin' birds, shit stains on 'em
Man fuck these niggas, I don't know these niggas
From Jumpstreet it's been M-O-B nigga
It's M-O-B since my D-O-B nigga
And since my D-O-B I've been on my J-O-B nigga
I shoot a nigga ass like Ginobili nigga
I kick a nigga ass like Shinobi nigga
I give your bitch dick like Moby nigga
She know the words to my songs, karaoke winner
Smokey Robinson couldn't out smoke me nigga
I'm on her cheese like anchovies nigga
I get a kilo and keep it lowkey nigga
Cause you on that bullshit and you nosy nigga
You on that bullshit ain't ya?
I'm back on my bullshit, gangster
I'm back up to full strength, gangster
Pat-pat at the pulpit, gangster, amen
And I still root for the underdog
And you the pile of shit under the underdog
These niggas ain't eatin' like a Ramadan
I shoot the driver in the head, make 'em honk the horn
I got the 100's big faces like a mongoloid (God forgive me)
I got the 100's big faces like a mongoloid (God forgive me)
Got big booty bitches in their under-alls
And they pussy gettin' wetter than a thunderstorm
And I swear when I'm in them panty hose
I'm like a kid in the candy store
But I got this bright red bandana though
Flingin' it like I'm a matador
You on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
Now, you on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
Now, you on that bullshit ain't you?

Yeah (yeah), yup (yup)
Yeah (yeah), yup (yup)
Yeah
It's Tunechi and 2 Chainz and we on that bullshit
It's 2 Chainz and Tunechi and we back on our bullshit
Yeah, yup
You on that bullshit
You come on with that bullshit
We gon' handle that bullshit
We gon' deal with that bullshit
So come on with that bullshit
'Cause we back, we back on our bullshit
You on that bullshit ain't you?
You on that bullshit ain't you?
I'm back on my bullshit
I'm back on my bullshit
I'm back up to full strength
Pat-pat-pat, amen
Yes Lord, we back on that bullshit
