1 ContributorWant This Forever LyricsDrake:
It may not mean nothin to yall
But understand nothin was done for me
So i dont plan of stoppin at all
I want this shit forever mayne
Im shuttin shit down in the mall
And tell every girl she the one for me
And i ain't even plannin to call
I want this shit forever mayne
(Lil Wayne)
Shit, nigga, this what i does
I swear i ain't lyin like this is my cubs
This is my tub
And im dirtier then the summer bitch
Weezy F. baby always lookin like i done some shit
You ain't know nuttin bitch
Better know who you fuckin with
Try to fuck me, i kill you and who you comin with
No homo, T I had to go stupid
Im on them high heels and i am no Boots
Collins avenue ridin with the phantom roof gone
Or the maybach two tone and my rims are to grown
That mean they 24's boy, what are you on?
Im richer then a bitch without the grey pupon
Yea, im talkin out of my head
I make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red
Ima blood muthafucka a blood muthafucka
Forever like E-T-C peri-od muthafucka

(Drake)
Look i tell her
I'm so unsigged, it would blow ones mind
Cuz to every single record i am so unkind
There are no holds barred there is no love lost
Nigga this that crack and you know drugs cost
So P-A-Y-U-P, i dont think you'll ever find another nigga like me
Neva L-I-E, i got everything i tell them i got
This young nigga showboat like im sellin a yacht
Ya heard me
Who else tryna smoke? yea nigga me too
Cuz take my mind off the presure is what weed do
Ya girl wetter then the bottom of a ski-doo
And take a bitch from any nigga its what we do
So bite down hoe and get the right dentist
I told wayne im goin in like a life sentence
And understand i send shots of who its meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that: 10-4

(Kid-Kid):
Put on my O-J gloves and go kill this shit
Make a plummer throw his plunger like "i can't deal with this shit"
The sound throwed off i stay on pitch
The flow ain't formed, well I dont slack on shit
Bitch im back on my shit like a fly
Since you wan' be fly throw you off the roof, fly
Like pookie, take a dookie on the rapper loose leaf throw
Andthrow trash bag through the window lookie
To a shark you just sushi
You ain't hard ya coohie walle oochie
Soft as newborn booty
Uhn said im movin slow im just thinkin fast
Look back I ain't behind ya, im bout to lap ya ass
And nigga I dont rest, im up until my times up
I been a tec' chef for all my beef prime cut
This ain't punch lines, nigga ya punch is lime (lame)
Cuz the only punch you ever gave was Hawaiian
