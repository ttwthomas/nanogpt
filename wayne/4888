28 ContributorsSalute Lyrics
First off I'm a mother fucking
G-EN-ER-AL word to the k shells
In this chopper I will p - p - p - p - pop 'em
Make it sound like a helicopters land on top of this bitch
You want this whopper come and get your beef nigga
I'm not a boxer, I'mma be brief nigga
Were on top I will put you underneath niggas
We the TAKE-YA-HO tribe and I'm the chief nigga
Your highest title, numero uno
I'm not that little pregnant white girl but Juno
You no anything within a niggas reach
My dogs will bite you and guess who the nigga leash
I was once told by my nigga Meech
You feed a sucka he just grow to be a bigger leach
So every time you hear mine
Get your hand to your hairline, general

Yeah I'm in this bitchh
Sending champagne to my enemies
Salute or shoot you choose motherfucker
Bow down till your head touch your shoes motherfucker
Salute me salute me salute me *(heavy voice) salute me*
Salute or shoot you choose motherfucker
Bow down till your head touch your shoes motherfucker
Salute Me! {*echoes*}
See Fabolous LiveGet tickets as low as $118You might also like
Uh, now just say hello to the captain
And I stay away from magnets cause the metals what I'm packin'
Bet yo brains on your shirt will look like Jell-O on a napkin
And I promise my fellows will put your fellow on the canvas
Call me Weezy F. Baby
Young money army, better yet Navy
Fab I got'em
And watch me get'em
And I do 'em or I did them
And this tool inside my denim
I shoot everything but women and kids
Bitch nigga stop bitchin this just how it is
Now watch me let that sexy Nina kiss you by your ribs
You won't be satisfied till I send a missile by your crib
Shoot you in the stomach now you pissing out your ears
Hollygrove all day
Bodies in the hallway
And If you come searchin'
Then you're finding out the hard way
Uh, no matter where your from
You better recognize a real nigga when you see one


At second thought I got the heart of a S-s-s-s-solider
T-t-t-t-told ya I ain't come to play y'all
My mind has gone AWOL
Find it I will pay y'all
My money is yay tall okay ya'll
A digit stacks is midget mack
That mean it's gonna stay small
Told them I don't see nobody
I'm a rapping Ray Charles (I don't see nobody)
I think I need a seeing eye dog
Come to being fly dog
You ain't seeing I, dog (ok ok ok ok)
We sit in here like pollen now
Fuck you niggas hollerin now
They said I been M-I-A
Yea bitch I'm on Collins now
Leaders dont be followin crowds
General like Collin Powell
War to me's a card game
Beef is just a style of cow
I'm who make the call
So dont make me get the dialin' out
Nick got the cannon, yeah that nigga be Wild-N-Out
They ain't ballin these niggas is fouling out
They ain't throwin jabs they just throwing towels out, yeah
