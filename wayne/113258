4 ContributorsMoney, Cars, Clothes Lyrics
Money, cars, clothes, hoes 
I'm from the ghetto so gimmie my money

Damn I hate a old fake ass nigga
Thats why you only see me with some ape ass niggas
We gotta eat early like break fast nigga
New Orleans landlord where yo gate pass nigga
Like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-0-4 yeah
Pussy ass niggas don't survive no mo
And the niggas say they riders
Ain't riders no mo
From the deep part of the water where the divers won't go
Hey sharks, sup piranhas
Them boys catfish, them boys flounders
I pop on roll, I roll around ya
Hit ya with that 2-2 7 times like Casandra

And fuck one time it's...

Straight burn ya body up like a skillet bitch
I turn beef to me meyou, be my fil-let bitch
And ya stomach ain't gotta hurt for you to feel dat shit
So ain't no love for no otha so say I fuck them tricks
Ain't no loves flyin now besides birds of them bricks
Unless you talkin bout eagle dats the street I know
A person on pro tools couldn't see my flow
I clap a nigga 3 times, like the 3 syllables
