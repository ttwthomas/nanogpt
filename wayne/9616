5 ContributorsI Know Lyrics
Okay

First thing first, and for me that's n's
I floss, so I know you gon' let me pimp Benz
If I want it, no matter the cost, I'll get it
It's mine, so I know you gon' let me spend it
My clique made it known: we 'bout havin' things
Sport diamonds, so I know you gon' let us bling
B.G.: shut it down when I come through
They say I'm wrong, but I know you gon' let me do what I do
If I got it, I ain't gon' hide it, I show mine
I know you gon' respect it, I know you gon' let me shine
I know you ain't gon' step, I know you know I tote iron
Quick to bust, and I know you don' wan' die
You see eight Bentleys comin' on a late Sunday
I know you know that's Cash Money Millionaires comin'
We be layin' it down, don't give a fuck, nigga
We're from uptown, so I know you gon' let us stunt, nigga (Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen)

I know you see the jewelry, it's berserk and on shine
I know you see the bulge under the shirt, don't try
I know you people wishin' that one day we gon' stop
I know you recognize we got the game on lock
I know you see the Bentleys, the broads, the Dubs
I know you see the thugs, you don't wanna see no blood
I know you people wishin' that one day we gon' stop
I know you recognize we got the game on lock
You might also like
I know you bet' not open your mouth when I ride by
I know you know this Lex GS on shine
I spin through fast, wrist hangin' out the dropped Jag
Blindin' ya, I know you gon' let me act bad
I know you gon' let me go off, let me show my ass
I know you gon' let me show off, make haters mad
Got game to make your wife cheat, give me head
Fuck your husband for Geezy, I know you gon' break bread
I know you clowns don't like it, gotta accept it
You don't, get wetted, I know you gotta respect it
You don't want Geezy bringin' drama to your set'n'
I know you don't want sis, Mom, and daughter in black dresses
Please don't test me, you do, it get hectic
I shoot for the head, don't depend on vests
Now on the up and up I'm every bad bitch choice
Don't be mad, I know you gon' let me be a Hot Boy (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I know you see the jewelry, it's berserk and on shine
I know you see the bulge under the shirt, don't try
I know you people wishin' that one day we gon' stop
I know you recognize we got the game on lock
I know you see the Bentleys, the broads, the Dubs
I know you see the thugs, you don't wanna see no blood
I know you people wishin' that one day we gon' stop
I know you recognize we got the game on lock
Hoes say I'm nasty, I know you gon' let me slang wood
Say I changed, I'm rich, I know you gon' let me be good
I'm the same ol' nigga I was when I was broke
Still beef, so I know you gon' let me tote my 44
Now, you know what happened: tried to play me like a hoe
We both can't live on this earth, one of us gotta go
On the real, when it come to shinin', I'm nothin' nice
You'll be blinded, and I know you don't like when I wear ice
I know you gon' let me burn, I'm H-O-T
I know you gon' let me be me, and that's B.G
I know you gon' respect my clique CMB
I know you don't want beef with Juv, Turk, and Wheezy
I know you don't wan' put your car next to Fresh or B
I know you ain't got the price like them: ten a-piece
I know you bet' stay in your place, don't fuck with us
I know you ain't on our level cause we platinum plus (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I know you see the jewelry, it's berserk and on shine
I know you see the bulge under the shirt, don't try
I know you people wishin' that one day we gon' stop
I know you recognize we got the game on lock
I know you see the Bentleys, the broads, the Dubs
I know you see the thugs, you don't wanna see no blood
I know you people wishin' that one day we gon' stop
I know you recognize we got the game on lock
I know you see the jewelry, it's berserk and on shine
I know you see the bulge under the shirt, don't try
I know you people wishin' that one day we gon' stop
I know you recognize we got the game on lock
I know you see the Bentleys, the broads, the Dubs
I know you see the thugs, you don't wanna see no blood
I know you people wishin' that one day we gon' stop
I know you recognize we got the game on lock
Lock, shop, bam, lock down
