5 ContributorsPussy MVP Lyrics
You gonna love me, baby!
Fresh checkerboard Vans and a T-shirt
And it's going down but she first
My flow sweet, make my teeth hurt
I spit ice cream bars, that's dessert
To me there's no such thing as a G-1st
Yea, my feature price high like a mink purse
I smoke a whole reef of the reefer
Drugs are bad but I beg to defer, sir
I just take a look at her face
So she can see that
My shades are Versace and she purr
Cause I'm a cool cat per say
So I give her my life and now I got eight, word
She asked me to go over her place, I said sure
She said shes been horny all day, I got the cure
I'm on her like turf
Now bring that ass, bring that ass
Bring that ass hurr, ya digg?
I, I, I don't know that you been told
But I can tell you something 'bout me
I smoke weed, I drink and I roll
Now is you fucking with me
Now I can't tell you shit 'bout the next man
But he ain't got nothing on me
Cause after a pill and half and a shot of Patrón
I'm a pussy MVPYou might also likeEmbed
