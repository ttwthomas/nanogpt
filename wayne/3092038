Yeah, I know you waitin' on another one
So girl here go the other one
Now grind on me while ya snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas
I know you waitin' on a special song
So you and your nigga can get it on
Now grind on him while ya snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas, yeah

Shawty, lady, what it Mountain Dew?
I can call you later, I can go out with you
If you snap ya fangas
It look so sexy when you do it 'cause you're doin' it good
I need all my babies, report to the parkin' lot
Chevys and Mercedes, everybody lean and rock
Snap ya fangas, I see you doin' it
That's just how we do in my hood

I know you waitin' on another one
So girl here go the other one
Now grind on me while ya snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas
I know you waitin' on a special song
So you and your nigga can get it on
Now grind on him while ya snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas, yeah

Stephanies and Keishas, you can ride with me
The Haitians and Puerto Ricans, sak pase, mami
Just snap ya fingas
It's 2 A.M. and I got plenty other places to go
All the Sophias and Tinas
You can call me T, you got so many bitches
I just wanna see you snap ya fangas
Let's get it poppin'
Ain't no stoppin', girl, you already know

I know you waitin' on another one
So girl here go the other one
Now grind on me while ya snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas
I know you waitin' on a special song
So you and your nigga can get it on
Now grind on him while ya snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas, yeah

Aw shawty like
Hello, hi there, then we eye stare
I tell her she can come sit on my high chair
Then we both laugh, she see I'm rare
Like magic, snap ya fingas and I'm there
This a cool song, make it snap on it
If I'd have had more room, I would have snapped on it
And call us by our new names
And that's "Featuring T-Pain and Lil Wayne"
I know you waitin' on another one
So girl here go the other one
Now grind on me while ya snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas
I know you waitin' on a special song
So you and your nigga can get it on
Now grind on him while ya snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas, yeah

Now lean, back, back, back
Forth and forth and rock
Now everybody snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas
Now lean, back, back, back
Forth and forth and rock
Now everybody snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas, yeah, yeah

I know you waitin' on another one
So girl here go the other one
Now grind on me while ya snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas
I know you waitin' on a special song
So you and your nigga can get it on
Now grind on him while ya snap ya fangas
Snap ya fangas, snap ya fangas, yeah2Embed
