75 ContributorsAll That (Lady) Lyrics
You know I love you like cooked food, I'm a good dude
Let's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is play your position for Birkin bags
We poppin' tags, her shoe game sick
We drinkin' Ace out of red bottles, true gang shit
Fuck with me and you're famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she’s away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plates, yeah, my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we'd grew into, whatever we into
That's too much for your mental, so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug, yeah, she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that
See The Game LiveGet tickets as low as $163You might also like
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let's be creative
She say, "Leave them tricks alone," but I’m a skater
I love her like her daddy told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I get her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, and yeah
She love my tattoos
Ain't got no room for her name, but I'ma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare-down
She said "I'm glad you ate it"—where my cap and gown?
Told her, "I can be your chauffeur," dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that’s my "M.O.," haha
Redbone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty, Tunechi

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that
Sean Don, whoa
Look, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
The D, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I'm looking down from Heaven
Screaming, "Oh, Hell no!"
When you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain't feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life (shit)
Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wade but we ain't on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me
'Cause she know me

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that
It make sense right, yeah
Girl look, I'm feeling your style
I'm loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You're killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills, girl
You're all that...14Embed
