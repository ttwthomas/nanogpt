4 ContributorsTop of Tha Line Nigga Lyrics
Top of the line nigga
Check

Excuse me, let me introduce me
La, la uptown top of the line HB
See I'm a million dollar nigga
Rolex on my wrist crushed
Ain't too many can touch
Baby I'm too much
I'm fifteen with fifteen karats
And fifteen figures with fifteen niggers
And fifteen hummers with triggers
I'm way at the top
Up the million dollar spot
Want to flex what I got
Make niggas sick like a drop
Every show I get
You can give a quarter key
Tryin to  sale but they cost six-five to see me
While we be goin' shows Baby transporting keys
Findin' out always to beat the N.O.P.D
But uh-uh
Can't stop me from shinin', no  uh-uh
Can't stop my Rollie from windin', yeah I
(*Sniff*) I-I blow niggas minds
Me and Prime up in the five
Dog it's top of the line

Nigga I just ordered me something new
Some six generation technology that's only made for movies
Comin' from Tennessee and I'm in Lousiville  on 23rd street
Hangin with this hot boy chillin'
Tryna find a way to drop a hundred keys on these niggas
And I peep in this shit that be shinin' like me, nigga
Ridin on twenties and be playin' these hoes
These niggas in Lousiville gotta a mouth full of gold
But see playboy I be bout that shinin'
These niggas bout that reppin'
While I be bout "BIG Tymin"
Nigga, I'm so true  whatever I do
I just bought new cars for the whole crew
I'm so top of the line nigga
I don't what to do
I bought Fresh a Lamborghini and me a loaders, fool
I got the jacuzzi nigga in the back of the truck
Runnin' water for your daughter when she want to get buck
Cable satellite dish, sony remote
 sold me a truck
 sold me the boat
I got some shit on my finger that'll blind the crowd
I got some shit in my truck that's way too loud
I'm the most looked back in the year '98
Y'all got to love me baby
Don't I look great
God, gave me the gift so I could share it y'all
Like Michael Jordan, y'all goin' see me ball

One million, two million, three
Oh! it's my part
That lil' nigga whole heart
Lexus automatic start
I shine like eighteen
And sparkle like a bezel
Ridin' up yo' block
In the fully loaded ledger
And the navigator on 
But that's for tomorrow though
Shaggin' up for hundred
With fat Julius and Mario
That slut that's me
In the GS 3
So play the backseat
Suck on meat watch yo' teeth
And um wipe yo feet
'Fore you step on the marble
Ding dong ?? bell worth a mill so what the hell
What like my smile
Three million dollar grin
What this me Wayne, introduce me to your friend
It's all gravy baby hot boy you should know it
In a Mercedes baby mm hmm that's beautiful
Look I'm large bro
Be flyin' up and down the lake on CBR's bro
In my garage ?? my place I got 4 cars bro
I swear me and my brothers we superstars bro
La-la it's marvelous
You see I "bloop" bust like a bottle I'm all wet
Go cash bout four checks
Yo' wife twat get more wet
I sticks to the cool
Reeboks and Girbauds
It's all about a mill
These hoes, diamonds, and golds
Say Whotay
La la need have diamonds like me
Whotay
Need to see the leather in the Humvee
Whotay
Us niggas six figures

Top of the line niggas
Say Whotay

Y'all tryin' to rub me like jeans
But y'all need to wear y'all own, man
Come on man you can't fit me, manEmbed
