You catch my girl legs open, betta smash that
Don't be surprised if she asked where the cash at

Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she asked where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she asked where the cash at

Bitches come a dime a dozen; I fuck 'em, sisters, cousins
It's a revolvin' door, pussy goin', pussy comin'
And when they go to you, it's coming back to me with money
I tell her, "Put them shoes on and keep my paper runnin'"
I put my mack down just like a G supposed to
And if she don't come home with it, then she sleepin' over
I got em creepin' over; we doin' dinner soda
I like the Ameries, you can have them Omarosas
Them niggas down below us, baby, we up and over
I'm tryin' to get inside that thing that sit between your shoulders
I'm talkin' large totals, I'm talkin' large motives
I'm talkin' burnin' rubber, that melted Pirelli odor
I'm hoppin' out a Lotus, you lookin' at my bitch?
You wanna holla, you can holla; take her on a trip
But when the deed done, you gotta send her back
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at
You might also like
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she asked where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she asked where the cash at

I got a bitch in the back, got a ho in the front
Got purp in the dutch, got purp in the cup
I tell her, "Get your money ho or just stop breathin'"
Cause if it ain't about that dough it ain't about me neither
See, a gangsta like myself? I get that paper and pussy
Then at once, I make that pussy bring that paper straight to me
Bitch! You lookin' at a real pimp, ask my old hoes
And they'll tell ya, no remote, I control hoes
I'm a whole load, give ya that game, mama
If he ain't payin', then he shouldn't be playin', I'm sayin'
Broke niggas only make jokes, nigga
I make more then I can fit in this quote, nigga
Unquote; come sun-soak with me, bitch
Fly you down here and put you on some South Beach shit
And if you smile at my bitch, I'll make her smile back
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she asked where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she asked where the cash at

See, that other chick asked that, she said, "Where the cash at?"
Rem said, "Where the paper, plastic, product
And where the stash at? Where the keys to the whip
And the crib and where the address of
That bitch that be hidin shit in her ass crack?"
Niggas I'm fuckin' call me baby like I'm related to Weezy
Some of 'em call me R-uh, none of them call me easy
Found out I'm fuckin' her man, now this bird is callin' me screamin'
Chicken, wait, bitches I be fryin', they just call me greasy
See, I know he got a main, but I'm cool being the other one
'Cause he can't get tight when he hear I piped another one
I dont fall in love with them, cum and then I'm done with them
Most they get from me is wet pussy and some bubblegum
But, this one dude had me laughin'
If it's just one thing I can't stand, it's a baggy Magnum
Would've thought somebody threw me a camera
The way I caught a flashback
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she asked where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she asked where the cash at3Embed
