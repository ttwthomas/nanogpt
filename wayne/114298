Momma gave me the swag, I walk like the President
Talk 'bout only dead presidents and big settlements
Yes, I have faith in the flag, yep, I'm a citizen
I'm repping for my city that is bad as the city is (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Momma ain't teach me no better but to get this cheddar
And that I do and for it I get at you
I consider you all fools, you niggas is hilarious
Young Money—bitches don't wanna fuck us, they wanna marry us
Now, ain't that some shit?
I can't have one bitch, but I just got one dick, and no—
I ain't fucking with the fake
I load my handgun with hand towel to touch a nigga face
I am something like a safe, I will never crack
Ain't no combination, nigga, never that
If a nigga ever said anything about Weezy and meant it
He gon' get it that same evening, pimpin'
I'm backseat riding like I'm Mr. Daisy
I am Weezy F. Baby, don't miss the Baby
I kiss the lady on her hand
I'm a fly young man, check my wingspan
This year, I probably do everything tan
Buy a crib on the sand, gotta float to the land, but
Don't get it twisted, I'll still die for me
And do a bid for my man, keep it real as I can
'Cause I'm strong, strong with a will and a plan
Where there's a will, there's a way, so make way for the fam
Young Money—I yell it 'til they come for me, come get me
I bet I'll take more than one with me
I know it don't take more than one shot
And for that reason, I'm gon' shoot more than one shot (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
I be clicking when the gun stop, I make the body hot
Then spit on it when the body drop
I get on it like a pot of crack, I get at your bitch
Then, I tell her like a rapper: "Holla back!"
I'm still asking, "Where the dollars at?"
I will smash you if you got 'em Jack, I'll peel faster
The lil' bastard in the Maybach
A young nigga, I still think saving is wack
I eat, sleep, shit, and bathe with my gat
I'm like, "Fuck pimping; slaving is back"
They like, "Yes, master, you the best, master"
My hoes need me, I'm like test answers
You don't need me, you might catch cancer
Come back from treatment looking like Van Axel
No, I don't like baldhead hoes
I like a long-haired diva with the bossiest goals
I'm a all day pleaser, your boy can't go
He too proud, I go where your boy can't go, oh
Nasty ass lil' boy
Put my feet up on the dash, pass the  grass, enjoy
Get the coke up off the glass, get the money out the drawers
Get the weed out the jars, and we do it like stars, haha
