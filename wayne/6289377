23 ContributorsThroat Baby Lyrics
Feel like we popped the best meds in the world, don't it? She want that medicine dick
Bustin' nuts, and she act like a squirrel on it, and my shit ain't never been bit
I get up in that pussy with passionate dick, she can never forget, this that elephant dick
Uh, go ahead, sit on it, I took my thumb out her ass, and had shit on it
I know she feel it all in her arteries, I paint her face like an artist
She smokin' on D like Marlboros, I need me a bitch with a twin like the Charlos
She lick on that tip till the tip is a hollow tip, fuck IG, let's make a porno flick
I like big pussy on somе soprano shit, monkey on this banana clip
Messy lil' clit, wettеst lil’ throat, hold on, hold on real quick
We have sex on the beach, go where nobody knows, we got sand on our feet and white sand on our nose
Two nights ago, came in you twice and more, you say you'd like some more, I know you nice and slow
Ooh, you a angel, swallow the cum and say, "Thank you," I say, "De nada, mi amore"
She wants some Topanga, let me get my dreads out the way, I'm a casket, put the pussy dead in my face
She pull the dick out while I'm sleeping, I'm having wet dreams, she forgot her bikini
Ooh, now she topless, but like Champagne Papi, I start from the bottom, I'm the pussy monster
Might not love her, so when I fuck her, I put both hands on her neck and remind her

Love the way you walk, love the way you talk (Talk)
All the bands on me like a broke gettin' a boss
She'll suck a bag hard but the dick goes soft
She just choked on a dick but a nigga dozed off (Dozed off)
Michael Jackson, how the diamonds dancin'
I'm the boss, wake up, make her buy a phantom
Say he rich forever, so they really can't stand him
Tell her, "Suck the dick with two hands, I'm handsome"
When I pull up, take a bitch, ain't no ransom
He ain't dropped a hit, he ain't got no anthems (Woo)
It's a plain Patek, I won’t rock no ring
She just ran the money up, now they can't stand him
Might take a bitch to my momma spot (Momma spot)
She was a freaky, she licked me like lollipop
All this water on me, know that I keep a mop
All these cars, it's a G comin', flex a lot (No, Baby)
No babies, you better swallow them for me (For me)
On your knees (On your knees)
You had to pay, I got it free (Free)
All these diamonds on me kickin' like Bruce Lee (Yeah)
Rich Forever, Young Money, the movie (Young Money)
With my dawg, ain't no Shaggy and Scooby (Yeah)
New Bugatti, I was ridin' with Tunechi (Rich)
You might also like
No babies, you better swallow them for me
On your knees, you had to pay, I got it free
No Ceilings, yeah
This part 3, she OAT
The GOAT, baby
