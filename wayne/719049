4 ContributorsNo Problems Lyrics
You already know what it is
No mula, baby

Smoking on that good in the Chevy with the top down
Yeah bitch (BLAH) who's a cop know?
Put that on my Maybach
Don't try us, you know that we stay strapped
Maybach, who's the boss now?
Got the Glock down, gonna have a rock down
And you know how we do it ho
Double M, Ricky Ross, cheerio

Got them goons gonna send them to your mansion
Got them goons gonna send them to your mansion
I just want my money. I don't want no problems
Yeah, I don't, I don't want no problems
I just want my money. I don't want no problems
I just want my money. I don't want no problems
I don't want no problems. I don't want no problems
Yeah, I don't, I don't want no problems

Haaan, I'm a cokeboy
A cowboy, got them ropes, boy
Haaaan, French Montana
Make that pussy spin like a tornado, Louisiana
Yeah I'm flipping birds, nigga
Yeah I got them words, nigga
I ain't never write no lyrics
I just write a check, get my words from niggas
