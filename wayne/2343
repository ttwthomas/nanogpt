Uh, uh, uh
David Banner on the beat, bitch
Uh, uh
I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a
I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
Now can I eat you? Now can I eat you? Mmm

I gotta taste for you, now what you wanna do?
Girl, you cold, let me suck out your flu
Girl, you cold, girl, you cool
You heard of Salt N' Pepa? Well, girl, you food
Girl, you hot like a bowl of hot stew
And I just stood over my stew and just blew
And when there is no more you in the soup
I remove my spoon and drink your juice
You wanna do me? Do what you wanna do
And if her job is to blow, you could bet she blew
Mic check, one, two, how's about one, two
P-L-A-Y because I don't have a clue
But when I find out, I'ma show and tell you
When I lift my top lip, I could still smell you
When I swallow my spit, I could still taste you
Put that pussy in my face every time I face you
It go P-U-S-S-Y
Because it's the reason I am alive
Mama, I need it to stay alive
It's like I gotta eat it just to survive
You might also like
Hi, I'm the pussy monster, the pussy monster
The pussy monster, the pussy monster
And you gotta feed me
Pussy, pussy-pussy, pussy-pussy
Pussy, pussy-pussy, pussy-pussy
I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a (Pussy, pussy-pussy, pussy-pussy)
I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
Now can I eat you? Now can I eat you?

Now let me get back to her
She call me Dracula, and I'll vacuum her
Catfish, catfish, that cat, tuna
I'll smack it up flip it like a spatula
Lil' Chris said 'Run It' and I tackled ya'
Baby, can I be the worm in ya apple butt?
Now go and back it up, and if you back it up
I'll suck the front of that pussy from the back of ya
And I'm a urban legend like a black Acura
My taste buds set on a black actress
(Action) The cameras is lookin'
And I hope she make me eat my words 'cause my words is
Pussy, pussy-pussy, pussy-pussy, pussy, pussy-pussy
Yeah, and I'm the pussy monster, the pussy monster
The pussy monster, the pussy monster
And you gotta feed me
Pussy, pussy-pussy, pussy-pussy
I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
Now can I eat you? Can I eat you?

I got pussy comin' to me, pussy comin' to me, pussy
Now show me that pussy, I'ma show you where to put it
And I could make it rain, I'm the hurricane, son
Say I could make it rain, wit' my hurricane tongue
Like la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Imagine if I did that with your pearl on my tongue, aha
I could make that pussy talk to me (Yeah)
I could make that thing jump off of you and walk to me
Now walk it out, girl, walk it out, girl, walk it out, girl
Pussy, pussy

I can make that pussy start crying, baby (Ayy)
And if you on fire, you know the fireman can put out the fire, baby, baby
Probably 'cause it's the reason I am alive
Mama, I need it to stay alive
It's like I gotta eat it just to survive
Hi, I'm the pussy monster, the pussy monster
The pussy monster, the pussy monster
And you gotta feed me
Pussy, pussy-pussy, pussy-pussy
Pussy, pussy-pussy, pussy-pussy
I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a
I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
Now can I eat you? Can I eat you?

I don't know what she thought, I don't know what she thought
I don't know what she thought, I don't know what she thought
I could play wit' that pussy like I play my guitar
