31 ContributorsHope You Niggas Sleep Lyrics
Yeah
Bad Boy
Cash Money
2000, baby!

Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts
Yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits
No time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes, I thought you know I'm smooth as a baby's ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn-born Teflon Don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah, ya'll, a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in their drawers
For the burner, catch a body
I got styles like karate
Jujitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe
Hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self; from Brooklyn, where else?
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I ripped your troop
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop
What you think, I'm stupid?
My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep
You might also like
I throw a bomb through your window
Burn you up and your ho
I catch your mama going to therapy and cut her throat
Your little sister walking home from school
I abduct her, then I fuck her
I hit your park close up with the Louisville Slugger
B.G.-zy is the hustler, ignorant motherfucker
I was taught how to bust heads by the best head-busters
Cluckers, you know I got 'em, two for one, my nigga
I'm on V.L. if you want me, get some my nigga, come on

Thugging is my thing; if I'm beefing, I'm banging
Slanging, it's in my nature, gotta be about my paper
Haters, I don't like 'em; bitches, I don't trust 'em
Niggas, I can't stand 'em, I creep down and pluck 'em
Strap stay in my hand, I gotta protect mine
Niggas trying to pull it off, "pop," goes the nine
That's how it got to be in these uptown streets
And a nigga like me, I play the game for keeps

I remember when niggas slang heroin up in balloons
I paid attention to everything, from killings to cartoons
Got a picture of Malcolm X on the wall in my room, bitch
Want some old nigga? Fuck with me, I'mma do 'em, shit
Nigga give me dope, I accept it, but don't respect him
Put my foot in their rectum right after I dome checked 'em
I be popping D, smoking weed, and full of that Hennesey
Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gonna mention me
I been out doing it for years--since elementary
Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consists of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit cause I don't fuck with scrubs
I don't need you harassing me when I'm up in the club
Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub
Quarter, ki's, and halfs is what I sling, cause that's what I love
I know you bitches know that I ain't to be played with
Dont have no picks and chooses who get they head split
They die quick, fucking with Turk, wodie get whacked
Spend a bin with Kevin and Randy leave ya flat on you back
And trust that, ain't bout to let no nigga steal me
Fuck that, I bust back with a .223
Big and full of that raw with no cut and be ready to creep
Innocent people move cause somebody fixing to get split

Na, Na, it's iceberg shorty, Lordy have mercy
Come from under my shirts and flip'em and reverse'em
I'm coming so alert them
(Ur, Ur) fore I hurt them, desert eagle bursting
You haven't seen the worst and
I'm right near you and my gun blast quick, dog
Could kill you so run, dash, get gone
Wodies movin slow around this time they got bricks dog
I ain't got bricks dog, nigga break it off, what

Un huh, B.I.G. with the Cash Money Millionaires, forever
Juvenile, Lil' Wayne, Baby, Turk, B.G., Manny Fresh
Slim, CEO, and me P. Diddy, B.I.G, Born Again
And we won't stop, get money niggas3Embed
