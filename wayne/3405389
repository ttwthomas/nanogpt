Yeah
Y'all ain't see this coming
G shit nigga
I had to do the remix

Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out, wait hol' up
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out, wait hol' up

Fuck it this a golden
The path already chosen
The Mac already loaded
The backwood looking bloated
And my killers look devoted
My children look supported
My cars look imported
My dogs looking forward
And the stars looking lower
The God looking over
The lawn looking mowered
It’s hard to look sober
But they looking over shoulders
They looking and they notice
Whatever’s in these sodas got me looking like a tortoise
Screaming fuck how it turn out
It’s all about the totals
It’s all about my brodies
Don't you know we some immortals
I pull up in that Lotus
Smoking rigor mortis
Passenger is gorgeous
Not enough to lose my focus
I got hoes that drive me crazy but I still would fuck your chauffeur
I got guns under the sofas and I treat them just like trophies
I got powers like a morpheus
Turn your child into an orphan
Send a bomb into your office
Now you're swimming with the crawfish
That's New Orleans
You might also like
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out, wait hol' up
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out, wait hol' up

Tell a lie to a nigga I'm too G for that
If I said it then I mean it, I can't take it back
If he coming, bitch a dummy, you won't make it back
A hundred shots in the drum nigga rat tat tat
I'm really about the gangster shit, y'all niggas not
Y'all some fucking house niggas I was on the block
Got my bag right nigga, now I'm on the yacht
Smash you on sight nigga, I'll lay the cop
Runnin' on you, 32 5 south robbers
Old side, new side, I fuck with all the robbers
Fuck how it turn, I fuck the world nigga without a condom
Had a shootout with the law, I just started firing
It's Hotboy nigga, yea Hotboy Turk
They got my name in their mouth like a fucking 
Old pussy ass niggas need to wear a skirt
Fuck how it turn I bet you I bust 'em, put 'em on a shirt
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out, wait hol' up
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out, wait hol' up

I ain't even got to rhyme, it's more deep than rap
Say we beefing I ain't tweeting, I'm too G for that
I done drunk too much lean, might catch a sleep attack
I don't love these bitches I cannot get deep attached
I'm from the Nolia 1800 block, I'm from the bottom
I ain't got to drop a hit, I drop a nigga like an album
Ain't got to be a scene, but I still listen
I'm in the Thunderbird, slidin' with a desert eagle
I'm a lil' thug I was a baby with a desert eagle
Ain't no blood, shell catch you with my red Adidas
I ain't no blood, shell catch you with my red 
I ain't no blood put a green beam on a nigga
Heartbreak kid nigga, Hotboy Kodak
Girl was fucking with me before all you niggas know that
Free lil Turk he caught 30, 40 got a 30 yeah
Walked in the building with the tool, watch the hammer go back
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out, wait hol' up
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Nigga fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out
Fuck how it turn out, wait hol' upEmbed
