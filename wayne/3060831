1 ContributorLoyal LyricsJust got rich
Took a broke nigga’s bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don’t fuck with broke bitches
No no
White girl with some fake titties
I took her to the Bay with me
Eyes closed, smoking marijuana
Rolling up that Bob Marley, I’m a rasta
She wanna do drugs
Smoke weed, get drunk
She wanna see a nigga trapped
She wanna fuck all the rappers

When a rich nigga wants you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
Oh, these hoes ain’t loyal
These hoes ain’t loyal
These hoes ain’t loyal
These hoes ain’t loyal
Come on, come on, girl, why you fronting?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon’ leave
And I bet your bottom dollar she gon’ cheat
Come on, come on, girl, why you fronting?
Baby show me something
You just spent your ring on her
And it don't mean nothing
