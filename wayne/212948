16 ContributorsThinkin About You LyricsCome on, come on, come on, come
Shout for the 17, shout for the Hollygrove
Shout for the 17
I'mma take it uptown, uptown
You dig
You understand me

Woke one morning
Tears in my eyes
And you had left me without a kiss or a note
Or goodbye
Now I got to learn to live alone
But my heart can't take it
I guess that's why I wait by the phone
For a call, a call from you
Sayin' she needs me back
Just as much as I need you
But I guess for the time, you need to stay away
Let me tell you baby, now I'm thinkin' of you every day

I'm thinkin' about you
I'm thinkin' about you

Oops upside your head
I said oops upside your head
I said feet, don't fail me now
White man came down to my city
On the corner
And asked me what do I do
I said, do what I wanna
Said, do what I wanna
You might also like
I keep thinkin' 'bout the good times we had
And how we let jealousy
Turn all we had good into bad
Now I realize
If you just try it again
Love will play out
You'll be my girl
I'll be your only man
