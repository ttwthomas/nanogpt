Sqad up, Sqad up, fuck that nigga at the do'
Sqad up, Sqad up, fuck that nigga at the back
Sqad up, Sqad up, fuck y'all
Listen

Now when we slide up in the club, we come in and do thangs
About every car that you name, on twenty-two thangs
We likely to have a few drinks, beat up a few lanes
Spittin game at a cute thang, make her get a crew brain
All the Heinekens in mo' if it ain't dro we don't want it
Cut my song on homie, yeah, that squad shit we own it
Droopy high come see the future, we livin' for the moment
Whole sucka on corners, the dance floor up pistols on it
And everybody know you fuck up, we killin' ya
The whole club familia' with my familia
Chicken heads Boriquas gon' follow where I go
I ain't got nothing for them but a dick and a taco?
And everybody know right where the gat me when they dap
 put yo eyes right when you lap me
And I ain't come to sign shit unless it's a bar tappin'
I ain't takin no pictures unless I'm palmin' her ass
Where the fuck y'all?

Let the thugs in the club, show us love
Show us love, let the thugs in the club
Let the thugs in the club, show us love
Show us love, let the thugs in the club

Chi-town let the thugs in the club
Let the thugs in the club, show us love

I like shinin' but dawg I'm in love with thuggin'
I like clubbin' but I get off when I'm beefin' and bustin'
I got a Bentley, Beamer', Benz, Lex
Got a bulletproof Hummer for just creepin' on 'sess
Got a Rollie, matter fact 'bout three or four
Got a couple of neckpieces that I wear at the show
Niggas know all the trouble that come with me
Niggas know it ain't the bluff that come from me
Me and my click draw party every week at the crib
For hustlers and convicts, they get it, how they live
 keep it real for the block and chill
Yeah I'm happy and wha 'cause I got a few mill'
Don't thank I won't steal, wrap the K and kill
Don't thank I won't say-uh a bird and crush the pills
When it's time to bling, nigga I bling
When it comes to do the damn thang, I do the damn thang!

Let the thugs in the club, show us love
Show us love, let the thugs in the club
Let the thugs in the club, show us love
Show us love, let the thugs in the club
Yo, yo
Now it ain't no secret that I'm slangin' and bangin'
And like a sack of dope rocks, my nuts be hangin'
It's Inglewood and Q.S., is the hood I'm claimin'
And I'm in already, so my colors is flamin'
It's for the project bitches who be backin' it up
And all the hardcore hustlers that be stackin' it up
And no matter where you from, represent yo city
If you a ghetto get crunk, if you's a diddy get chicky
Get yo walk on, rib-riders if you true blue
Get yo bang on, and thow yo hood up, die move
While I buy the whole bar cuz you no one know
I got a spotter and a front and a ragtop fo'
I keep it ghetto, gutta, gangsta like a West Coast G
The homies trust The Dopeman so we got in free
Like a stampede rust through and or we sell
Was let a stoo' bitch and get shot in the head
Ba, ba, ba, ba!
