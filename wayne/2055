47 ContributorsFire Flame Lyrics
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars

Fresh out from my bid, bitch, it’s Lil Tunechi
I Lucille Ball, bitch I love Lucy
If these niggas dogs, I’m animal cruelty
Don't fuck with me at all, cause I’m twisted like in a Rubik's
Cube, oh my, look how the time has flown
And they say time is of the essence, but what if their clock is wrong?
But all my problems will be second and all my worries will be gone
I’ll have money bags for breakfast smell like “Bitch, I’m rich cologne”
Ha, I’m so relaxed my Gucci flats ain't got a scratch
If you got a problem with I, well I will fix them cataracts
They say it cost to be the boss, I paid the price including tax
Bitch I’m a fire flame spitter and, to me, you niggas wax

Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars

In this World with my Tommy gun, banana clip the red rum
100 millions dollars, put my life down for my son
Spend a little cash, bust a nigga ass
5-star nigga, 2 mill on the dash
Yeah, militant minded
Uptown soldier, you have been blinded
Grinding all the time, bitch, stunting, and we shining
Diving in deep shit, the money keep climbing
Blah, the bottles keep popping
Dom P, Rose, Perrier popping
Them bitches see we rocking the whips we be rocking
Iced up, tatted up, fire flame blaaap

Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars

I got pussy coming to me
Shotgun in my draws, make your woman bite the bullet
Sitting in my hog, tell my chauffeur, “To the penthouse”
Pockets so deep, it's like my money gotta swim out
Marley say fuck 'em, Scoob say fuck 'em
Bitch I’m still the best overall like a jumper
Weezy F-F, fire flame spitter
Hundred million dollars, pocket change, nigga
See these first class flights, we strapped up in the trenches
Nigga want some business, bitch, we getting it in this business
Some ten figure niggas, blood rich gang nigga
Fire flame spitters, point blank nigga
Money and the power, swag out the shower
Spending nigga, then them pussies running like some cowards
Bigger Than Life nigga, C4, bitch
A hundred million dolllars, my son born rich
Blaaapp
