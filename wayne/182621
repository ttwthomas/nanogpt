And I’m a monster, Monster of this Rap Game
Then Yo’ Girl can’t handle this Monster in the Club

No Problems and Yo’ Shawty’s thinks of me the Reaper
In the streets just a Savage Animal
Chorus
I’m Monster
Of Chicago
Then I’ll shoot lights out (Monster, Monster, Monster)
Only in city of Chicago
Were she thinks she is the boss nigga but her stuff stinks like everyone else's
In Chicago Riding in A Dodge Challenger with Her Nigga not
In Atlanta
Were I getting so High on That Blunt not messing with Yo’ Nigga’s
And My Attitude is so crazy when comes I'd like to do something

Verse1:
Were Yo’ Nigga’s go in Berserk around in neighborhood like
Not on house arrest, were I don’t care about what’s happen to you’ll
