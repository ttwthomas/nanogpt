Yeah, I see you, big bro
I'ma kill these niggas, man
Yeah, haha

Straight off the block with it (Block with it)
Eagle Street, to be specific (Specific)
I'm peeping at you people different
I pay my dues, you keep the difference (Keep the difference)
I can see the end in the beginning
So I'm not racin', I'm just sprintin'
'Cause I don't wanna finish (Wanna finish)
They diminish, I replenish
Scientific, I'm out this world, ho
I wear bright red, like a girl toe
No homo, fingernails dirty
I've been counting dirty money since 12:30 (12:30)
​​​a.m., weigh them, if they short, take them
Right back and spray him, amen
Yeah, I just do my Wayne
And every time I do it, I do my thing
Yeah, believe that, like a true story
Rims big, make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out, that'd be suicide
No back seats, call that paralyze
I don't have a spine, I don't fantasize
I mastermind, then go after mine
You see, I handle mine, I dismantle mine
I tote a tool box, bitch, it's hammer time
So excuse me as I nail 'em 'til some fell
I'm just repel 'em, I'ma kill 'em, someone tell 'em I'ma kill 'em
I'ma fill 'em up, his mama can't tell 'em
And the doctors can't heal 'em
I'ma kill 'em and, yeah, we sell 'em, I know you smell 'em
And if you want it, you could just yell it
And it be in the morning, at your 'telly
Whole ki' go for twenty, half a ki' go for eleven
After me there, will be nothing
I am legend and I Will Smith
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch

That's how you let the beat build, bitch
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch
Let the beat build, bitch
And the beat go
Boom, b— boom, b— boom
Boom, b— boom, b— boom, it go
Boom, b— boom, b— boom, now say

Heh, c'mon, just a snare and a 808
Weezy Baby on the mic, D.O.A. 
Okay, I'd like to thank Kanye
And my nigga Deezle from giving me this Diesel
Like an F-350, tank never empty
Damn, everybody in the bank act friendly
Used to think my shit didn't stink, boy, was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'ma take it one-two, way back
Like a silk wife beater and a wave cap
Or the wave pool at Blue Bayou
And I waved, fool, as I blew by you
Hello, hi, you, I can buy you
But I wouldn't try you, feed you to Piru
I know what I'm doing, I show and prove and show improvement
And I know just to go into it, could never amount to going through it
Whatever, how you wanna do it, we can do it like we late
Ayy, wait, Deezle, let me just get the 808
As I hit the kill switch
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
And the beat go
Boom, b— boom, b— boom, it go
Boom, b— boom, boom, the beat go
Boom, b— boom, boom, now everybody say, yeah

That I am the best rapper alive
I am the best rapper alive
And I will eat you alive
Think I'm lyin'?

Damn, I'ma get in a nigga chest like a bunch of phlegm
Like a fucking ram
On the hunt for the lamb, I'ma dump 'em, man
In a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier, ask Uncle Sam, hair nappy like Pam
Nigga, fuck your plan, fuck your man
You ain't a pimp unless you get the same bitch
To fuck your man and fuck your clan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh, goddamn, there's my sample
Play it like that's my band
Gotta get it cleared, suck my dick
With red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos
And I meant every tear
And I'm still on that street shit
Back to the beat, bitch
That's how you let the beat build, bitch
Now what's how you let the beat build, bitch
Let the beat build, they say
And the beat go
Boom, b— boom, b— boom, it go
Boom, b— boom, boom, the beat go
Boom, b— boom, boom, now everybody say, yeah
And the beat go
Boom, b— boom, b— boom, it go
Boom, b— boom, boom, the beat go
Boom, b— boom, b— boom, they say37Embed
