37 ContributorsBigger Than Life Lyrics
Look around, is this where you wanna be? Yeah (Yeah)
This shit bigger than life (YMCMB, nigga)
And we ain't gotta play around, no, no, no, no
And when the sun come up, we gon' be alright
Speak up on it, baby, I'ma get it alright (Fully loaded)

I want you to know, this is (I am my brother's keeper, nigga)
We are bigger than life (Million dollar views)
Bigger than life (Flashy lifestyle, yeah)
Ooh, when the sun goes down, it'll be alright (Sun do shine, nigga)
This is, we are bigger than life (100)

Uh, the city love me every night
When you winnin' to the fans, it ain't hard to decide
She know we fly, she pick a flight in no time
I'll be by my own business, why you busy mindin' mine?
You was on my level, we both came from the ghetto
And later we're separated, we hate it, I'm glad you made it
When your mountain top, they say there's nowhere to go but down
But I'll be chillin', just look around
Perpendicular, mama be straight forever
Her crib about a hour, now she a out-of-towner
Predicted it be better, we change the game like quarters
Two dimes together, they high five until whatever
I can mention your name, but I'd rather keep it clever
YMCMB, I'll tell ya every letter
She just wanna chill with a star, feel special (This is, we are)
No stressin' no pressure, I'll bless you (Bigger than life)
You might also like
(Yeah, haha, yeah)
Bigger than life
Bigger than life
This is, we are bigger than life
Bigger than life
Ooh, when the sun goes down, it'll be alright
This is, we are bigger than life

Yeah, money on the grind (Grind), money on my mind (Mind)
Do it big time, Junior headline (Junior)
Big money nigga, hustle hundreds nigga
Old school nigga, hundred mill nigga
Chandelier lights, Persian on the rug (Rug)
Roberta for the bitch, nine for the plug (For the plug)
Count a hundred G's, fifty on the piece (Piece)
Cookin' up some ki's, flip it with some B's
Yeah, every day the same grind (The same grind)
Up late nights, nigga tryna flip mine
Born to shine, plaques on every shelf (On every shelf)
Blind any weather nigga with the Smith and Wess, braaap
Million on the whip, nigga (On the whip, nigga)
Shit, Gucci bag full of chips, nigga (Full of chips, nigga)
Yeah, and I got this game off the floor
Movin' bricks on the low, hundred G's full of dro (Pound for pound)
Yeah, uptown off the mound, nigga
Shut it down, put it down, put it in every town, nigga (High life)
Big money, stay poppin' (This is, we are bigger than life)
Uptown real nigga
Bigger than life
We're bigger than life
This is, we are bigger than life (Ayy)
Bigger than life
Ooh, when the sun goes down, it'll be alright
This is, we are bigger than life

Uh, smokin' on the good
Killin' these hoes like Blair Underwood
Dreads in the wind, blowin' like a ribbon
Gettin' money like a bitch, um, Robin Givens
God is my chauffeur, take to my destiny
White girl, Black girl, I call that a referee
I'm definitely alive, bullshit aside
Red flag in my pocket, I caught a bullseye
I ain't never gave a fuck about another motherfucker
Every night I pray to God that I don't kill a undercover
Word to my mother, give the world to my mother
I swear when my mama die, that's when I'ma die
Fuck bitches, get money, Young Money go hard
Skate hard, big B's, no honey
Got that drop top Maybach, smellin' like payback (This is, we are)
Payback, uh
Look around, is this where you wanna be? Yeah
This shit bigger than life
And we ain't gotta play around, no, no
And when the sun come up, we gon' be alright
Speak up on it, baby, I'ma get it alright

'Cause I want you to know
This is, we are bigger than life (Yeah, yeah)
Bigger than life
Bigger than life (We are)
This is, we are bigger than life
Bigger than life (Sticks on deck)
Ooh, when the sun goes down, it'll be alright (Sun do shine, nigga)
This is, we are bigger than life (I am my brother's keeper, braaap)9Embed
