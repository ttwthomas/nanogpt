17 ContributorsLouisianimal (50 Cent Diss) Lyrics
Get down or lay down
Louisiana

I'mma animal Louisanimal

I got em
Call me Lil Weezy-ana Carter, I go harder
All about a dollar, fuck two quarters
Bitch, I'll pour syrup in that Vitamin Water
I hope you die ugly, and tonight'll be gorgeous
Feed me your organs, bitch, I'm starving
Teardrops on my face like it's my party
And if it's my party, I can cry if I want to
Split your fucking body up in half if I want to
Bitch, I'm from New Orleans, but I'm going everywhere
And I have a dream to be your worst nightmare
I'm in the king's chair watching Sportcenter
Then I cut on BET—ah, dinner
Throw your L's up 'cause we taking over
And we hungry, so please come with a chip on your soldier
And we got them guns that gotta sit on your shoulder
I rock ice, but my heart colder
