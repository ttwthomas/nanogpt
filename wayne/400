11 ContributorsReady for the World LyricsWhen you look into the mirror in the morning
Co you recognize who you see
When I look into the mirror in the morning
I don’t see anything
What happens when the sun don’t rise and the birdies don’t wana sing
And even the flowers of the day die and then they stink
And then they shrink
And even the friend of mine says the shrink might work
And I was thinking bout clearing my mind but im afraid it might hurt
And just when it seem that I got the whole world at my door
The bell ring and I open up with a bang
Im ready for the world im ready for you girl
Im ready for the world im ready for you girl
Im ready for whatever for now and forever
Im ready for whatever for now and forever
Im ready for the worlld the the the world
Im ready for the worlld the the the world
Wait til they get a load of me
Psychotic, my pilot left the air craft
Good weed like im smoking on some tear gas
How ya want I can specify mother fucker
Snearker sceintist I second high the mother fucker
Pissed off no more like shittin on
Get it good bitch I get til the getting gone
3 words bitches: "It is on"
Big dawg are the kittens home

Hmm yall ain't ready tho I get so much green they call me lil ready go
Is you ready 4 5 and the the leather coat and shoot these mother fuckers and whoever cope
Somebody better let em know I ended the banana clip in and in your cantaloupe
Fruity niggas suck a dick fuck the world, I'd rather fuck a bitch
Starin at the walls of the room figurin out how to get out
And theres no window to escape your mental drought
You think about the crossroads more than the man that's conducting the train
And then you lift your protected you still can't fuck lil wayne1Embed
