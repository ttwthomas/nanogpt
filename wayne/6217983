27 ContributorsDrive Bys Lyrics
Yeah, I'm off a bar, they want me out of here (Boom)
My heater gon' air out the opposite (Boom)
On the block with my ice, still rockin' it (Yes)
While she silenced, the girl put a sock in it (Woah)
I got hitters and killers, they arsonists
I got drugs, I'm a street pharmacist
He a rat, the Glock must be arsenic
Whip the pot, I put my whole arm in it, damn
I keep the fuego, they know the style (Yeah)
Corrupt, so they want me to break down (Boom)
If the mafia house a stakeout
Why don't you take out his family and head count
Why would I fuck with these niggas who don't keep it G?
Why I need friеnds? All my partners deceasеd
Been a hot boy, this the demon in me
Back to the block, I got used to the streets

Pull up, pull out, cut loose, run through
One clip, unclip, new clip, action, part two
Fuck you, who you? You new, you too new to me
I don't do you, do you, D-E-U-C-E
Doom, doom, do shrooms, smoke ooh-la-la, oui, oui, oui
High AF, got a PHD in THC
Don't stunt, don't stunt 'less you got one, not one
I pop one, not one
Look up and thank God 'cause I'm one
Amen, and I've been a man since I can pray, man
And say amen, okay, can I get an amen?
I shake land, never shake hands
No fingerprints, that's stinky stench
Got me thinkin', bitch
What it mean when my trigger finger itch?
Put a ring on it (Woah)
Chopper ring, like freedom, yeah
Put you in the sky, you will never land
Like Peter Pan, you gon' see the man
You gon' need 'em, yeah, huh
I got demons, yeah, blonde, blonde dreads
Black thoughts under this beanie, man
No Beenie Man I'm a thinkin' man
And I've been thinkin', man, what you thinkin', man?
You might also like
I'm thinkin' drive by, huh (Drive by)
Walk down, curb side, head shot (Yeah)
I'm thinkin' big racks (Big racks)
Saw it off, chest shot, Mad Max
I'm gon' big dope, I don't need to stress (Woah)
Run it up, I'm 'bout to make it stretch (Woah)
In the trap, I should've never left (Woah)
Watch yourself before we make you next
I'm thinkin' drive by

I'm thinkin' drive by, yeah
I'm thinkin' fireflies, yeah
I'm thinkin' dragons, young nigga head on fire
Hot head, yeah, gassin', matches, ashes
I'm thinkin' out of the box
Passenger side, I'm hangin' out with a chop
I'ma pull up, like what up?
Baow, baow, baow, what up now, nigga? Baow, baow, huh
I wish a pussy motherfucker would
I let this cookie cutter cut 'em good
I make his cookie crumble 'till I'm full
I chop a nigga family tree to wood, ow
I'm thinkin' Sammy the Bull now
I'm thinkin' family reunions, I'm thinkin' picnics, I'm thinkin' cookouts
Thinkin' full clips for a full house
Piped up on a full tank
Air the whole neighborhood out
My dawgs turn into a wolf gang
Better take off or get took out
AR with a clip on
Hit a nigga dead in the chest, like Saquon with the stiff arm
Damn, I'm thinkin' drive bys (Yeah, yeah), yeah
Walk ups, run downs, kick doors and lay down, yeah
Big guns, no noise, small guns, but they loud, yeah
AK's, MK's, SK's, okay
Pin drop, locate your place, drive by
I'm thinkin' drive by, huh (Drive by)
Walk down, curb side, head shot (Yeah, yeah)
I'm thinkin' big racks (Yeah, yeah)
Saw it off, chest shot, Mad Max (Yeah, yeah)
I'm gon' big dope, I don't need to stress (Yeah, yeah)
Run it up, I'm 'bout to make it stretch (Yeah, yeah)
In the trap, I should've never left (Yeah, yeah)
Watch yourself before we make you next (Yeah)
I'm thinkin' drive by

Walk down, curb side, head shot
Pull ups, pull up, pull out
Sawed off, chest shot, Mad Max
I'm thinkin' drive by
Walk down, curb side, head shot
Pull ups, pull up, pull out
Sawed off, chest shot, Mad Max
I'm thinkin' drive by

Ayy yo', this record right here is called "FL4M3$" by Lil Tune, Lil Wayne's son
